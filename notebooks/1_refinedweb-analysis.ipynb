    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "- In the initial phase, the project will proceed on-premise, which has limited memory usage and RAM; therefore, it will start with a small scale. - The Apache Spark application is needed to scale up to large-scale processing.\n",
    "- Additional space has been received for 32 GB in Ai8 Server.\n",
    "- **Remarks**; This is the first notebook for preprocessing and exploratory analysis, the advnanced modelling can be seen in 2_refinedweb-analysis_nlp"

    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to reduce the memory usage of a pandas DataFrame by downcasting numeric types and converting object columns to categories. This is especially useful for large datasets used in machine learning and NLP pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Saves RAM during model training, especially on large text datasets\n",
    "- Makes preprocessing pipelines more efficient\n",
    "- Helps avoid memory bottlenecks on limited hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Float precision loss:** Using `float16` or `float32` might affect model performance if high precision is needed (e.g., embeddings, logits)\n",
    "- **Categorical conversion:** Converting string columns to categories is memory-efficient, but may not be ideal if the column contains many unique values (e.g., full sentences)\n",
    "- **No automatic conversion back:** Once converted, original data types are lost unless explicitly saved\n",
    "- **Not GPU-aware:** Does not account for compatibility with GPU-based libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which might require specific dtypes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this function on numeric IDs, flags, and metadata,not directly on raw embeddings or floating-point model inputs unless you're sure precision loss won't hurt performance."

Colors are fun and indeed an essential, but without a few key neutral pieces, you'll continually find yourself surrounded by bright colors that lack basic styling links, which will leave your wondering why you have nothing to wear. By properly stocking your wardrobe with a few neutral pieces your styling options will instantly double. If you’re a color fiend you can think of these pieces as the perfect canvas for showing off one of your prized bright colored pieces such as a neon pink scarf or a mint green clutch. When styling your neutral ensembles I always suggest adding some contrast and dimension by incorporating tonal textures like eyelet shorts or a crochet vest. Khaki, cream, white, blush, brown, black, and grey are a few of the most popular neutrals..\\nBelow are some of my favorite neutral pieces that are perfect for incorporating into your summer wardrobe:\\n1. Pleated Top 2. Sheer Maxi Skirt 3. Embroidered Scarf\\nAbsolutely love this look!!\\nBooks in my bags\\nFACEBOOK FAN PAGE\\nI like the idea of creating contrast by buying textured neutrals.

       "      <td>from Milk Teeths The ultimate style+travel photo, and I liked that blouse so much I bought it from her store!\\nI generally aim for a high degree of original content on this blog, but I really enjoyed rounding up my favourite summer outfits from some of my favourite bloggers in September, and couldn't resist doing an autumn roundup too. However, I've gone a bit overboard, so I'm splitting this post in two. This week you get the vibrant colours and sunny days outfits that most inspired me, next week a few more from the more wintry side of autumn. Since I featured my winter coat last post, and am basically wearing it all the time now, I guess autumn is truly over, in London at least...\\nI Want Your Dress:\\nfrom Yeye! Style Blog and Resplendent Tranquility\\nThis was the year the Alexa Chung collection for Madewell had us all pining for black velvet dresses with little collars. Seeing Izzie's vintage example, I was inspired to spend hours of my life trawling Etsy for weeks, instead of spending too much money, and I'm very happy with the result. I also love her styling of it.\\nYou can't see it well in the picture, but Emily from Resplendent Tranquility's dress has a pattern of chickadees! How perfect for autumn. I skulked around in H&amp;M for quite a while in search of this, but fortunately for my budget they didn't have my size. And I could never have mustered up such a perfect location for it anyway!\\nColoured Denim:\\nfrom Orchid Grey and My Little Fashion Diary\\nAfter I bought my red Zara jeans I was pleased to see other bloggers following me on the coloured denim idea! ; ) Joking aside, red and yellow are probably the best autumn colours around, and I love the difference in the way they've been styled: sort of grunge-folk on Julie and classic all the way on Emilie. And both with truly great shoes...\\nCaitlin in Yellow\\nfrom Waking Life\\nI honestly think Caitlin from Waking Life is one of the most stylish girls in blogland, and she made me doubly despairing of my own dressing abilities all fall by consistently wearing my favourite colour so perfectly. If you don't know her blog already, you should: head over for one perfectly put together look after another, and most of them taken before she goes to work, which just boggles my mind!\\nI Just LIke These Ones:\\nfrom Waking Life and Birds Closet\\nMore perfect looks with oatmeal and red, and also demonstrating that sometimes hair is the best accessory. Well, hair and a swallow-shaped brooch, if you can swing it.\\nKeeping Cozy:\\nfrom Wish Wish Wish and Hannah and Landon\\nCarrie's yellow coat set me back ages in my own coat shopping. I couldn't come to grips with the fact that I wasn't going to find the very one and make it mine.\\nHannah's sweater looks warm too, but what really keeps me cozy is the picture itself. Taken during Canadian Thanksgiving, it reminded me in all the best possible ways of my favouritest of favourite holidays.\\nAny favourites among these? Or what were your favourite colours/looks this fall?\\n49 comments:\\nLove finding new blogs. Thanks for pointing me toward Waking Life. I can't wait to check it out.\\nAlso the last pic/ensemble from Hannah and Landon is possibly my favorite.\\nLeaving the House in THIS?!?!\\nYayy I love all these!! Such stylish girls :D\\nLove these! Especially the Waking Life one. SO cute!\\ni am checking out all of these ladies next! thank you so much for sharing i love all of these looks :)\\nGreat photos! I love the first one especially :)\\nGreat selection and a couple of these blogs I hadn't even come across yet! I am going to check these out right now :)\\nI love the yellows red and oatmeals although strangely I have gone off on a pastel trip just recently.. maybe I am trying to blend in with the fog?\\nThat is a nice looking pick up van.\\nooh, I like the oatmeal &amp; braids.\\nI've been searching for a pair of red jeans, but by the time I find the ones that fit the way I want, the trend is likely to be over.\\nI love Autumn pictures. Great pictures. :)\\ni need to crack onto this mustard yellow! i love it. xx\\nTotally agree - loving colored denim right now!\\n~jess\\nabsolutely love the colored denim looks! they look so fresh and simple!\\nThanks for the round up- always great to find new inspiration!\\nthese are all VERY stylish girls! As are you! :D\\nI love the outfit with the red jeans.\\nweee.. i'm enjoying these photos. thanks for sharing their links.\\nAww these are all so cute! Great photos:)\\nrawhem.com\\nThe last bloggers have great photos of themselves! Wow, I am blown away from the art of it all!\\nI'm too lazy to be stylish. haha.\\nlove every girl + putfit!! but the girl in the first picture is my favorite :D\\nxxxHanna\\nI love this idea for a post because there are so many fantastic outfits here. I adore Emily from Resplendent Tranquility. She is so sweet and a very beautiful person.\\ni love this post. it's great finding new blogs every now and then :)\\nfivetwocharm.blogspot.com\\nGIRL. Thanks for the inclusion ;) Now let me see a photo of you wearing that blouse! AND I wore a pair of red skinnies today and totally thought of you!\\nxx\\nMILK TEETHS\\nawh these are so lovely x hivennn.\\nGreat post! I really liked how you made a post with your favorite inpirations in blogland :) I loved so many details in every outfit!\\nMy color favorites are always the same thing more or less...(shame on me - I'm really boring about that) black, grey, etc etc**\\nvery cute post! love the autumn/winterish colors and themes you've picked! happy holiday season &amp; hi from 5amjetaime.com, gabbie c\\noh my gosh, i loved seeing all of these! what a fun roundup. i think milk teeths is my fave pic :) i love her shop\\nwow these are so cute, i love the coloured denim!\\nColored denims, Cozy coats, pops of yellow - sounds like my kind of party ... and I am obsessed with autumn and all the bloggers showcasing it beautifully from all parts of the world! :) Love it.\\noooh amazing post!!! There are so many great trends in here :)\\nxxxx\\nlifeisroyalty.blogspot.com\\ni love this post! some of the outfits you've selected are gorgeous - i especially love carries yellow coat too :) x\\naw, thanks for including me!! you're awesome. i have a yellow coat quite like carrie's but I got it three years ago at nordstrom and it is looking a little worse for wear. you know i love yellow :)\\nYou've picked some girsl with amazing autumnal style! I love all the earthy tones and beautiful yellows.!\\nLove your picks. I am such a huge Bird's Closet fan that it's not even funny!\\nAw, thanks for including me in your autumn inspiration round up :) I wore that chickadee dress yesterday. Gosh, I loooove it. That's a bummer you weren't able to find it. They put out a blouse version, too. The print is a wee bit smaller, but just as sweet.\\nRed and yellow are such perfect autumn colors. I like all these photos very much! I'll definitely be doing some new blog visiting as a result of this post.\\nI think we have the same preferences, I like all the pictures you chose with their colours and outfits.\\n@ Emily: I might go back and see if any hit the sales racks! I didn't fancy the blouse so much... I'm such a dress girl!\\ni love all the looks, but im especially digging the mustard pants - i've really been wanting a pair myself!\\nall of the mustard yellow looks are great!! that color happens to look terrible on me, but it's perfect when i can incorporate it into an accessory or pair of shoes.\\nThose are some very cute looks that you've rounded up. I think my favorites are the last two photos. I love the yellow jacket paired with the brown polka dot dress - those aren't colors I would usually put together but they looked wonderful that way. I would wear the outfit next to her in a heartbeat.

       "      <td>From a reader:\\nI am a lay Catholic and over the month past month I have felt truly\\nhome since going to the Mass of the Ages.\\nPlease forgive my ignorance but the missal of blessed John XXIII has\\nomitted the prayers at the foot of the altar at certain occasions and\\nthe 2nd confiteor before reception of the Eucharist of the faithful.\\nAre these changes though indiscernible harmful to the faith or\\nnecessary and part of the organic growth of the Mass?\\nThe 1962 Missale Romanum (the Missal of John XXIII) did not omit the prayers at the foot of the altar, except in the normal circumstances (e.g., Good Friday). And there is a curtailed form in the Requiem Mass.\\nHowever, the 1962MR does not have the 2nd Confiteor before Holy Communion. In many places, I would guess most places, it is done anyway regardless.\\nI don’t think it is harmful to the faithful to omit the 2nd Confiteor. It is not harmful to the faithful to be without the prayers at the foot of the altar.\\nAt the same time, consider that these two elements of the older, traditional form of Mass were omitted in the Novus Ordo even though the Second Vatican Council’s document on liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium said that no changes should be made unless it should be for the true good of the faithful.\\nI cannot quite make out how the faithful benefit from the removal of those things. They might not necessarily be harmed, but… how do they benefit?\\nSurely you jest, Father.\\nI don’t think there was any intention to change only what the good of souls demanded. This becomes blatantly obvious when you begin to itemize the changes and ask, “how were these so harmful that it was necessary to remove them?”\\n- the dates (and celebration) of most feast days\\n- the elimination of ember days\\n- the greatest majority of the texts of the Mass\\n- the elimination of minor orders and their roles in the liturgy\\n- the prayers at the foot of the altar\\nAnd this list could go on for quite a long time. Remember folks, Bugnini was largely responsible for the document Sacrosanctum Concilium itself, and he knew what the bishops needed to read to get signatures — and he knew how far his ambiguous document could be stretched.\\nRe: the second Confiteor\\nA very good priest explained in a class on liturgy a couple of years ago (FSSP), that the second Confiteor was really for the congregation to confess one more time in humility, hoping for the forgiveness of our sins to prepare for Holy Communion. He stressed that we should be saying the Confiteor to ourselves with the altar servers, who are speaking in our name before the “Domine non sum dignus” for the congregation. There is nothing more beautiful, moreover, than the Deacon and Sub-Deacon at a Solemn High Mass, going to either side of the altar, bowing low as the Deacon chants the Confiteor. It is such a beautiful chant. I often find myself chanting it when I’m driving in the car – a little odd maybe – but we can’t confess enough, can we?\\nAt our Latin Masses, no matter which one of the four priests come to say the EF, (not a parish, but assigned priests), all four say the second Confiteor. These priests went to St. John Cantius to learn the EF several years ago. Is this ok? As they all do it, I assumed that is what they were taught to do.\\ncomes not come-sorry\\nIt would be helpful to know WHY there was a second Confiteor in the first place.\\nUntil Pius X encouraged more frequent Communion just over a century ago, Communion of the Faithful was less common. When it was done, it would often occur after Mass. This ritual would begin with the recitation of the Confiteor by the server, followed by the priest holding up the Host for the “Ecce Agnus Dei …” much as would be done in the pre-1962 form of the Traditional Mass. It was not considered part of the Mass proper. In fact, you will not find the Communion of the Faithful in the priest’s missal at the altar, even in the 1962 version. And in most comprehensive hand missals until the late 1950s (Dom Gaspar’s Saint Andrew Missal, etc), it is listed as a separate event in an appendix, in addition to its location in the Mass.\\nAnd so, once the Sacrament was more commonly received, the entire ritual was simply inserted after the Communion of the Priest as the norm. Thus the appearance of the “second Confiteor.”\\nThe “second Confiteor” is not in the 1962 Missal, but its continued use is indulged by the Holy See. That it is not officially included, cannot be definitively attributed to any one person, other than perhaps the Holy Father himself, who ultimately approved the change. In all likelihood, it was removed simply because it no longer served its original purpose. On the other hand, a tradition often retains its value after its purpose has faded away. The case could be made either way, without the usual conspiracy theories.\\nAt the parish where I am MC, we do not use it, but its use is brought to the attention of servers in training, and they are told what to do and when, in the event that their experience takes them elsewhere.\\nMe, I could go either way with it.\\nI’m curious about our other readers — how many recite the 2nd Confetior quietly to themselves when it is not recited publically??\\nI must confess that I also say it before receiving Comminion in the Ordinary Form.\\nAt my parish’s EF Masses the servers do not say the 2nd confiteor. I do, however, say the confiteor to myself (followed by a few “SHJ, have mercy…”) as I am in line at the communion rail.\\nI find that it is a great way to bring clarity to the situation.\\nI have said it from the time I was Confirmed (1951) along with the alter boys, if the Pope wanted it there I see no right reason to eliminate it.\\nBeing a humble theology student still grappling with the complexities of the pre-novus ordo form(s) of the Mass, I may be about to put my foot in my mouth.\\nI would probably guess the second confiteor was originally the equivalent (along with the other prayers around it of the Eastern Communion Prayer said in the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. This prayer is a confession of our sins, our unworthiness to receive, and a beseeching of God to heal us.\\nOne could say that in the western rite, it has now been lessened to “O Lord, I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word and I shall be healed.”\\nWith these thoughts in mind, I wouldn’t say that the loss of the second confiteor is harmful in that it does not diminish the action of the sacrifice and we strive to retain it’s sense with “O Lord, I am not worthy…”. I would say, however, that its loss does not maximize the experience of mercy and gift that should accompany reception of the Eucharist. Acknowledging one’s sinfulness in a dramatic way (like the Eastern Communion Prayer) is a sure way to instill in a person the need for examination of conscience and the reminder that receiving unworthily could lead to judgment or condemnation makes one understand the gravity of the sacrament.\\nHearing it in a Ruthenian Rite scared the crud out of my mother, born and raised Roman Catholic.\\nSo I don’t think it’s loss is harmful. However, I think its addition, or a prayer akin to it (Eastern Communion Prayer), can do great good.\\nFr., I believe the questioner had in mind the various omissions of the prayers at the Foot that were indeed novel ommissions. You say normal, but what is that?\\nIt was not omitted on Palm Sunday, Candlemas, etc until the reform in the 1950′s\\nAnyhow the 2nd or 3rd Confiteor makes perfect sense to me in light of the historical fact that the confiteor at the beginning is not about the people. The priest confesses, then the other sacred ministers confess. These confessions, like the rest of the prayers at the foot, evolved as prayers said to fill in the time of the introit. Only in a roundabout way, via low Mass, is the idea instilled that it is somehow a confession of the congregation. The original purpose was a confession before entering “in sanctum sanctorum”\\nNow especially at a sung or Solemn Mass, the 2nd Confiteor is very significant. The people do not hear the earlier ones and, in fact, can be singing the Introit. But this confiteor is explicitly for them. That it was imported a long time go (before Pius X, before Trent in fact) into the Mass from communion given outside of Mass is also true of the Ecce Agnus Dei (which mimics the Agnus Dei) and the Domine non sum dignus following that (mimicking the priest)\\nThe Dominican Rite prior to 1958 did not even have the Ecce Agnus Dei. Very simply the priest receives communion, and has his own Domine non sum dignus, and then proceeds to distribute.\\nSo that it was imported in does not mean that its purpose does not make sense, any more than with the Ecce Agnus Dei\\n\\\\I am a lay Catholic and over the month past month I have felt truly\\nhome since going to the Mass of the Ages.\\\\\\nAnd just what are the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and other Eastern Liturgies, to say nothing about the other authorized Western rites, such as the Mozarabic, Bragan, and even Novus Ordo?\\nChopped liver?\\nThere was a time that NONE of these liturgies, including the Tridentine Rite, existed, therefore NONE of them can justly be called “the Mass of the Ages”–unless ALL of them (including the Pauline Mass) are.\\nWhat Manwithblackhat said about the second (or possibly third) Confiteor is historically true.\\nAs far as frequently repeating this prayer on the grounds that “one can never confess enough,” it can be a symptom of spiritual OCD, otherwise known as scrupulosity.\\nSooner or later we have to get our eyes off ourselves and onto God’s forgiveness.\\nOne does wonder how Bugnini got away with all he did, and over and over one asks why Paul VI signed off on the N.O.????\\nSince the N.O. is the primary Mass I attend accept for a E.F. Mass once a month, an act of Contrition is the prayer one tries to use prior to receiving Our Lord. but food for thought will now start on my own and quietly saying the confiteor to myself.\\nI can think of a reason why it should be omitted: accusations of disobedience.\\nFor years the 1962 Missal was fought to be “freed” (as popular parlance spoke of the matter). Now that it is “freed” people are not even following its rubrics.\\nFor the sake of consistency of argument, the 2nd confiteor ought not be said.\\n-KJS\\ngloriainexcelisdeo — You reminded me of something I’ve been meaning to ask. Does anyone who is familiar with the FSSP’s custom of having the deacon and subdeacon chant the last (2nd/3rd depending on how you count it) Confiteor before communion at High Mass know how that started? The only time it should be chanted (according to my books) is at a pontifical High Mass.\\nI think it’s noteworthy that Psalm 42 and not the “prayers at the foot of the altar” is what is really in question. This psalm was really a part of the celebrants preparation for Mass and was inserted into the public prayer of the church in the Missal of Trent. The historic liturgies of religious orders (Dominican &amp; Carmelite) do not have this psalm. It was simply the In nomine… Confiteor…kyrie. The Introit is out of place in all of the rites as it ended up right smack in the middle of penitential stuff?! I think “they” tried to fix this. Many orthodox liturgists saw the fault in this. The confiteor before communion is simply out of place too. All the penetential stuff was done at the beginning then we abruptly go back to the confiteor?! All that being said, I wouldn’t say that these things were harmful for anyone.\\n@Fr. Basil,\\n)….\\nIMHO, it’s not an “either/or” matter – either focusing upon ourselves, or focusing upon God.\\nInstead, it is the Catholic “both/and” – looking at all things realistically – the reality of how sinful we truly are AND how much they truly do offend God infinitely, no matter how “small” they might be – as well as realizing that if we express heartfelt contrition for our sins &amp; aim to make amendment in our lives, God will always extend to us His Mercy and forgiveness.\\nI agree with Fr. Z – taking out the 2nd Confiteor was NOT clearly beneficial for the laity.\\nPax et benedictiones tibi, per Christum Dominum nostrum,\\nSteve B\\nPlano, TX\\nThat’s always been my question with the way the new Mass is celebrated (not necessarily how it appears in the missal itself). There are so many things that are optional that “liturgists” choose not to do it simply because they don’t see the point. There is no consideration for any theological reasons other than it’s optional, so why do it at all? Instead, they just add in things or omit what is not optional, thus making it harmful.\\nI am surprised that others have experienced FSSP priests incorporating this confiteor–at the parish I attended for about two years, I never saw it done. As far as how we benefit from the removal of this confiteor: I don’t know what the benefit necessarily is one way or the other. But, now that it is removed, there is a benefit in simply, obediently doing what’s in the book.\\nFr. Z: Doing something “for the true good of the faithful” is one reason changes could be made to the liturgy, but I don’t believe it is the only reason. Sacrosanctum Concilium cited other reasons, such as securing the full and active participation of the people (#14), or if something is shown to be an intrusion which does not harmonize with the inner nature of the liturgy (#21), impedes the faithful from understanding the rites with ease (#21), or is not part of an organic growth when the liturgy is seen historically (#23). In addition, in the revision of the rites, SC calls for a careful investigation into structure and meaning of each part of the liturgy, as well as what is learned from experience of the indults of the Holy See.\\nIf we were to simply go by what is for the “true good of the faithful” almost anything could be inserted into the liturgy. As a rite that communicates grace from outward signs, and signs which must be clear and simple, the liturgy must not present signs which are not merely emotionally fulfilling. What does this part of the Mass do, or accomplish? Is the rite doing this, or have other goals and desires crept in to this part? Is the introductory rite of the Tridentine Mass also the priest’s preparation, and also his contrition of sin, and also the contrition of the ministers, and also the Kyrie, and also the adoration of the Gloria, plus an entrance antiphon (Introit) stuck in between, plus other prayers of humility while kissing the altar, plus, plus, plus ???? So exactly what is this first part of the Mass supposed to accomplish? And if some of these parts were inserted in the 4th, 5th, or 6th centuries, for what reason, and was it true organic growth.\\nThe comment I hear from people in these blogs is “but I feel good when the 2nd confiteor is done. They should never have changed it.” That may sound like a defense of tradition, but it could also be very much a parroting of the liberals’ mindset that we keep things in the liturgy because they feel good. And if that’s the case let’s just ignore the fact that the Missal has dropped the 2nd confiteor, because we don’t have to go along with any change that we don’t agree with. For instance, “The English translation should not be changed, because I feel better with the present translation.”\\nThe second paragraph above should state: “If we were to simply go by what is for the “true good of the faithful” almost anything could be inserted into the liturgy, or allowed to remain there unchanged. As a rite that communicates grace from outward signs, and signs which must be clear and simple, the liturgy must not present signs which are merely emotionally fulfilling.”\\nI was trained as an altar server in 1956. At that time, I was told that the server’s Confiteor at the foot of the altar was the server’s confession and that the server’s Confiteor before communion was done as the people’s representative and that it was important to keep this in mind. Therefore, when the Confiteor before communion was eliminated, I was scandalized and lost much sleep over it. Was I no longer fulfilling my mission of representing the people? Now, perhaps what I was taught was the personal theology of the nun who instructed me and had no basis in fact. I didn’t now that then and I don’t know it now. All I know is that without the pre-communion Confiteor, something doesn’t seem right and no matter how much theologising I hear against it, that doesn’t change my feelings. That said, of course, this should not be all about my feelings, and I agree. I’m just saying it was all very hard on a 14-year-old boy who loved the Mass.\\n“As far as frequently repeating this prayer on the grounds that “one can never confess enough,” it can be a symptom of spiritual OCD, otherwise known as scrupulosity.\\nSooner or later we have to get our eyes off ourselves and onto God’s forgiveness.”\\nThere is nothing scrupulous about not being able to confess enough and knowing this. There is everything scrupulous about not really believing it. That is the peculiar pride of the scrupulous conscience. After all, it is precisly the realization of not being able to accuse ourselves enough, I’m speaking about a true realization rooted in humilty, that propels us forward in the hope of God’s Mercy. Without this it is nothing but presumption.\\nA Legitimate Liturgist priest-scholar (who gave a conference on Chant at which I met the most wonderful Fr. Z) holds that the ‘third Confiteor’ is a vestige–as Mr. Man With Black Hat notes above.\\nBut there’s a bit more than his explanation.\\nYears ago, in a tradition going back many MORE years, a number of the Faithful would arrive at the early weekday Mass just in time for Communion. They were called “daily Communicants.” (Yes, I’m old enough to remember them, including being able to name several from my home parish..) Don’t ask me how that started, or why. I don’t know.\\nAnyhoo, that ‘third Confiteor’ was there for them, too.\\nNow, few (if any) people are “daily communicants” in that way; most are able to attend the entire Mass.\\nAs to B-16 “indulging” the practice: I’d be very interested in seeing documentation of that claim.\\nFinally, it is supremely ironic that a certain Order of priests (based offshore) demands–and I mean DEMANDS–obedience from the laity on issues large and small–yet flagrantly and knowingly DIS-obeys the 1962 Rubrics on this matter.\\nSome things never change.\\nFr. Sotelo wrote: “The comment I hear from people in these blogs is ‘but I feel good when the 2nd confiteor is done. They should never have changed it.’”\\nThat is not what I am seeing from people above. I am reading many comments about the liturgical point of the 3rd/final Confiteor: that is, it is the one for the people receiving communion. Not for the priest (1st Confiteor) and not for the server (2nd Confiteor). So if there is a congregation to receive communion, the final Confiteor is said with the final absolution. If not, then no. Archbishop Bugnini did not give a reason when he hacked off that prayer — he did so without sufficient explanation, so now we have the mess to clean up.\\nAs an aside I find it interesting that most traditional Latin Masses that have a priest who will not allow the 3rd/final Confiteor still recite the Prayers After Low Mass. If you’re going to do one, do both — they were each deleted in the same Bugnini package. The latter, however, features the congregation making vocal responses, my guess as to why more liberally-minded TLM priests are apt to keep them while scrapping the final Confiteor.\\nWhen my family attended the Indult Mass in my youth, the priest followed the rubrics for the 1962 missal so there was no 3rd Confiteor. If the Confiteor before Communion was for the people (as some have stated), it makes sense that it would be omitted at some point during the liturgical renewal of the 20th century. No matter how the Confiteor became part of the prayers at the foot of the altar, by the 1960′s, hand missals and textbooks and the example of the Dialogue Mass had taught the laity that the altar boy’s Confiteor was their Confiteor too. If Rome has given permission for the insertion of the 3rd Confiteor in the 1962 Missal, great. If not, please don’t do it because some of us don’t like illicit practices, even in the name of tradition.\\n//…some of us don’t like illicit practices…//\\nAlice: From my reading of Fr. Z’s comments and the comments of other contributors, it seems that the situation is not one of illicitness but of allowing something that is not explicitly forbidden. If the final Confiteor was explicitly forbidden, then it would be illicit – but it doesn’t sound to me like it’s explicitly forbidden. It may merely be regarded as irregular, but acceptable. For example, if I intentionally start a fire in a restaurant I would violate the law. But, there are many other things I could do in a restaurant that would not be illegal but would also not be acceptable. Just as there are things that are not explicitly allowed by the law that are, nonetheless, perfectly acceptable. Perhaps Fr. Z will clarify.\\nNot for the priest (1st Confiteor) and not for the server (2nd Confiteor).\\nThe altar servers, like the choir, are representatives of the faithful. The confiteor that they say during the Prayers at the foot of the altar are said on behalf of the people AND for themselves.\\nis not one of illicitness but of allowing something that is not explicitly forbidden\\nSay the black, do the red.\\nWhat Jesuit school trained you?\\nThe latest fashion from our NO pastor is to leave out the first Confiteor….\\nwolfeken: There is in the sacred liturgy a communal prayer led by the priest, acting in the person of Christ but also acting on behalf of the members of the Church, which is directed to the praise and glory of the Father in the power of the Holy Spirit. During certain parts of the Mass, the Church asks the people to actively join in, and at other parts to allow the priest alone to speak on behalf of the people through Christ, with Him, and in Him.\\nIn Sacrosanctum Concilium, the Church asks that all the prayers recited by the priest be seen as prayers on behalf of the people, not “his prayers, the servers’ prayers, the servers’ or priest’s prayers on behalf of the people.” The liturgy is not meant to be chopped up into compartments which certain people posses as their special property. So technically, we only need one confiteor, and one of everything else.\\nAs far as the Low Mass prayers, those are not part of the liturgy and are not relevant to a discussion of rubrics, per se. In the 1962 Missal, it is not required to follow Low Mass with the Leonine prayers, but since Mass is finished at that point, the priest and people are free to engage in any devotional actions they may wish without violating any Mass rubric. The Church encourages, outside of Mass, any and all devotional prayers, including the reciting of the Leonine prayers. On the other hand, the pre-Communion Confiteor is part of rubrics within the Mass, and the insistence on including it is a violation of the rubric. I don’t know why we must dispense ourselves from “Say the black, do the red” at this part of the liturgy but not others. It is very simple. The priest and servers at Mass should not be doing what is not prescribed.\\nFather Z wrote, “However, the 1962MR does not have the 2nd Confiteor before Holy Communion. In many places, I would guess most places, it is done anyway regardless.”\\nI do believe this is the case, as I attend the EF at a FSSP parish and the Confiteor is always there before Holy Communion. At every FSSP Mass I’ve ever been to, in fact, this has been the case.; the commenter did not say anything about other Western Liturgies or about the Eastern Liturgies. Certainly other approved liturgies are worthy of our attention, but isn’t it okay to prefer one Rite over another? Especially if the preferred Rite is a commonly accepted Rite of the region where one lives, and more importantly, if the preferred Rite is celebrated in the parish or diocese where one lives? Additionally, the title “the Mass of the Ages” has, for quite some time, been understood to refer to the EF form of the Mass.\\nPretty good discussion here.\\nAs a member of a Schola, I find myself grateful every week for the Confiteor before Holy Communion. Why? During the 1st confiteor, I’m busy singing either an Introit or a Kyrie, so the extra recollection is very helpful.\\nChris\\nSeveral things,\\n1. I do not know what the current status of the prayers after low Mass are, but in 1962 they were no optional. They could, however, be omitted in certain cases (when the Mass is followed by Benediction or a procession, when a sermon is given, when the Mass is celebrated with more solemnity-e.g. a nuptial Mass, etc). This at least is what the most recent edition of Fortescue-O’Connell-Reid states, as well as the Ceremonies of the Mass by O’Connell\\n2. The FSSP follows a very simply rule in general here. Where it was retained as custom, the 2nd/3rd confiteor is said in their Masses. Where it was not so retained they do not re-introduce it. Hence the different experiences of different people\\n3. Wolfeken- assuming the 3rd Confietor is still allowed in 1962, it is certainly permissible to chant it. The rubrics do not direct this, but custom sanctions it. We make a mistake when we read rubrics as if they were American laws. For instance, according to the rubrics a processional cross is used only in Pontifical Masses and a few Masses a year (e.g. Palm Sunday). Yet in English speaking countries the use of such a cross is common place. Or again, according to the rubrics the bell at Mass is rung a) at the sanctus, b) sometime shortly before the consecration c) either once continually, or three times for each elevation. d) Shortly before communion to single to the faithful who may wish to receive to come up. The exact manner (e.g. at the Hanc Igitur) is not determined, and custom admits a variety of other rings.\\nTo all- In the Ceremonies of the Roman Rite, Canon O’Connell has an excellent chapter on rubrics and custom. Read it before you start accusing priests of disobedience. Or else get equally worked up about a processional cross being used, the omission of the Sanctus candle, or the use of more than one server at low Mass of a priest (actually that last one was reprobated several times by the SRC, who allowed the use of more than one only when there was a just cause)\\n4. As a point of fact, it is not disobedience to have the 3rd Confiteor. I wrote the Society of St. John Cantius about this (and have talked to various priests, e.g. Fr. Berg, FSSP). Fr. Scott Haynes, SJC gave me this.\\nNow I would like to see said copy of the SCR decree and obviously can only trust that what this priest wrote me is true, but I think it is downright scandalous and indeed the utmost disrespect to the priests of the FSSP or ICR to call them disobedient. You would have to claim also that priests of the SCJ, FSSP, et al. are liars. It may well be legitimate to wonder about how this works, to ask a priest if he can show you where permission is had or point you in the right direction, etc. But to jump to, as many com-box attackers have here, accusations of disobedience is abhorrent\\nTo clarify: what I have been told by the FSSP is that they were given permission for it where it was still customary upon their arrival (whether that means a pre-existing Latin Mass group, or, as with the SCJ, it was done in the 1960′s I do not know). My understanding is that they don’t want to “rock the boat” too much with communities that expect it.\\nI use my father’s 1954 missal at Mass, and expected the 2nd Confiteor – and I got it at the regular Friday Mass I attend. I did notice one week when I forgot the Missal, that it was not in the LMS version. I also saw it at the FSSP Masses.\\nI like it, because I am occasionally prone to distraction and thus venial sin at Mass, that I love to feel that I am confessing and receiving absolution quietly at the point I have finally decided to receive Communion. I am not over-scrupulous – it just feels right.\\nI\\nOf course, our priest simply removes the first confiteor from our O.F. Mass and dispenses with the whole problem…\\n\\\\)….\\\\\\nIn the Apostles’ Creed, it says, “I believe in the forgiveness of sins…..” Does that not mean we are required to believe that (should the spiritual conditions be met) our sins are forgiven?\\n*; **\\nIt is one thing to love or prefer one particular rite and spiritual tradition of the Church. I make no secret that I love the Byzantine tradition. This does not mean I do not respect the other authorized Liturgies of the Church, and assist at them as I am able.\\nHowever, I have noticed that aficionados of the Extraordinary Form frequently use the term “mass of the/all ages” to assert that is it somehow inherently superior to the Ordinary Form, if not all the other authorized Eucharistic Liturgies as well. In my experience, many of such people have not even HEARD that there are Eastern Liturgies, or even non-Roman Western liturgies, but are merely using “mass of the/all ages” in a triumphalist way.\\nOthers labor under the mistaken and outdated notion that the Roman Rite somehow has some kind of pre-eminence or priority or perfection, and the more an Eastern liturgy is assimilated to it, the more “perfect” it is.\\nIt seems there is plenty of reason to say that the 2nd/3rd Confiteor is legitimate. The Leonine prayers are basically a “prescribed” devotional, but I don’t see why we do not just keep them going. I do not see any reason to throw around terms like “disobedient” and so forth. It is especially quite beautiful at a Solemn High Mass.\\nAs to the other liturgies and the “Mass of the Ages”, at least in my experience, other TLM fans also appreciate the other traditional liturgies-East and West. However, it is just the way it is that the Latin Rite has the preeminence in that it is the most wide spread. When most people think “Catholic” they think of the Roman Rite. Even in the secular world, when they want to paint something as Catholic (especially in film) it is often in varying degrees of the pre-Vatican II Roman trappings. Its basically shorthand to speak of all things Roman as preeminently Catholic, inaccurate yes, but resonate with lived collective experience.\\nMuch thanks for the original post and all of the comments.\\nI recently moved to a parish which includes a traditional Latin Mass in its Sunday Mass schedule. Having grown up with the Latin Mass (Vatican II began when I was in grade school), I was very pleased to dig out my old Latin-English missal again. But I was really puzzled by the “extra” Confiteor right before Communion. I had never experienced that before. So I was really wondering what was up.\\nIt’s nice to have some of the historical background now.\\nDear Joshua08:\\nThank you for your contribution on the last confiteor; it ought to be more widely known.\\nSincerely,\\nJohn Pepino\\nWhen the Confiteor was dropped as part of Blessed John XXIII’s revised rubrics in 1960, permission was given shortly after by the Sacred Congregation of Rites to continue the second Confiteor, where it was an established custom.\\nFine, assuming that there WAS such a custom, uninterrupted. And I’m sure you can supply a citation, which would be interesting for all parties.\\nBut when it is re-instated despite strict obedience to the 1962 rubrics (from 1962-200X), the argument from “custom” is void. That is a case, by the way, with which I am intimately familiar. (The disobedience extends to using the “Benedicamus Domino” at all Masses during Lent and Advent, another practice which was deleted, and there are other seriously questionable practices which I won’t discuss here.)\\nThen we have ‘disobedience’, plain and simple.\\nAnd if one digs around enough, one discovers that the 3rd Confiteor had been dropped (de facto) in most cases because there WAS NO celebration of the EF from ~1969 to ~2000. How can one claim “uninterrupted custom” with a 30-year gap?\\nThe origin of the practice was thoroughly explained above–which also thoroughly explains the reason(s) it was dropped. (See Black Hat’s entry.)\\nThe Roman Ritual as late as 1964 still provides for the use of the Confiteor before the reception of Holy Communion by the faithful as an option\\nThat was covered under my entry for “Daily Communicants” who did NOT attend the entire Mass.\\nYou’re applying legislation to the wrong case.\\ndad29: Very good point. A custom is something that should endure for years, and yet if the EF has been gone all those years in most communities, how can one claim a “custom” as reason to continue the confiteor right before Communion?\\nBeyond the issues of “oh well, it’s already a custom here” or “we don’t want to confuse the faithful” there is the tendency of priests to simply do what they wish to do at the liturgy. This is actually not willful disobedience. It is simply a tendency of many priests, both liberal and traditionalist, to do things during Mass that they sincerely believe are for the good of the faithful and fall under “epikeia” or prudential judgment. The thinking is to make up your mind on a liturgical practice, and then build a theological or legal rationalization around it, or find refuge in obscure indults, special permissions, etc. I find that disagreeable, but that is simply how priests tend to think when they deal with liturgical practices which they feel like/insist on doing.\\nDad29,\\nI believe that the SSPX has reinserted the pre-Communion Confiteor since their founding, so in some places it is “established custom.” If a priest in union with the local bishop offers the EF in a place where the SSPX has been established for a while, I can see why Rome might have given permission for this priest to reinsert this Confiteor. I just don’t know that Rome HAS given such permission and without it, it should not be done.\\nFr. Basil,\\nThank you for not ascribing to malice would could be ascribed to ignorance, but I am not sure that is always (or even often) the case. I can still get worked up about one book I read by a Latin Rite triumphalist who argued that since the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom was only published 10 years before the Council of Trent, it didn’t fall under the established tradition exception or remembering how our priest told us that there were no rubrics in the Divine Liturgy so the priest was even freer to do whatever he wanted than in the Novus Ordo. Many people are ignorant about the different variants of the Western Mass, which are older than the Mass which Abp. Lefebvre called the “Mass of All-Time” but at least in the circles I found myself there was an active dislike for the non-Latin liturgies.\\nThis is actually not willful disobedience. It is simply a tendency of many priests, both liberal and traditionalist, to do things during Mass that they sincerely believe are for the good of the faithful and fall under “epikeia” or prudential judgment.\\nYes, well….\\nSometimes that ‘confiteor’ issue is part of a larger pattern of willful deviations from established norms, in which case(s) “closing one’s eyes” is imprudent–and people are obligated to speak out.\\nI understand “pastoral” considerations. But at the same time, expecting the laity to live to standards and at the same time being a bit………flaccid……..seems to me to be a dangerous path. Which rules are to be obeyed? Which are to be gently ignored?\\nAnd no, I’m not talking “salvation is at risk” here, but still……VatII places very great weight on the Mass.\\ndad29: And therein lies the controversy over the pre-Communion confiteor. There is an unspoken assumption in the EF Mass world that the present Magisterium should indeed be gently ignored, at times, in matters regarding the liturgy. To repeat a favorite mantra of many people, “the novus ordo is a big joke. What right do novus ordo hierarchy and priests have to question the Mass of the Ages?” Of course, Fr. Z doesn’t tolerate that disrespect in his blog, but it doesn’t mean that many folks do not quietly think that way towards the present Magisterium.\\nI can understand why the FSSP would gravitate to reciting the last confiteor. The SSPX recite the pre-Communion confiteor, and for many they are still the true standard of what is Catholic. And sad to say, the FSSP is at times dogged with the accusation that they are not really as Catholic as the SSPX, that they are compromised, watered down, and not as free as SSPX to be true defenders of tradition. That is not my opinion, by the way; I deeply admire the FSSP. But if the FSSP tell their priests to not recite the pre-Communion confiteor, it does leave them vulnerable to the accusation that they are indult wannabees who are prepared to act just like the “indult priests” who are not true priests but “presbyters.” In some ways, reciting the pre-Communion confiteor is a way to say, “see, we still offer a true Catholic Mass.”\\nI still don’t buy, Joshua08, the argument that custom allows the final Confiteor to be sung in a non-pontifical High Mass. The missal is very clear as to what is sung and what is not. And it (or the Pontificale Ceremoniale) very clearly says the final Confiteor is to be sung at a pontifical High Mass.\\nIf a “custom” arises to sing this pontifical privilege at a regular High Mass, then what is to stop a “custom” of singing the final blessing?\\nAs far as those who claim the traditional Latin Mass was “gone” from 1969 to 2007′ish, it is possible that it was gone from your world, but recall the people who worked to get the 1970 Agatha Christie indult, the JPII 1984/88 indults and the Benedict motu proprio have been saying/hearing this Mass validly in one location or another non-stop. Please don’t assume the Mass magically re-started when you attended the novus ordo. To that end, it absolutely makes sense to say the old SCR permission for a final Confiteor still applies.\\nIn some ways, reciting the pre-Communion confiteor is a way to say, “see, we still offer a true Catholic Mass.”\\nUmnnhhh….see today’s post on this very blog.\\n.\\n—wherein “he” is B-16, speaking to the Bishops of Italy.\\nThere is no real dilemma here, just as there is no ‘dilemma’ in stating that “He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood…”. Either take it or leave it. There was no ‘pastoral shimmy’ in those words, good Father.\\nBy the way, I’m sure you’ve noticed that no one has YET come up with a citation “indulging” this practice. Moreover, it is irrelevant what SSPX does or did. Their abuse of the Liturgy cannot license another abuse of the Liturgy, can it?\\nAh, well.\\nThis video from the 1940′s shows the chanting of the 2nd confiteor. I again urge that people pick up a copy of O’Connell (pre-1962 versions are at least online) and read what he says of custom. Try to stop thinking like a modern about prescriptive law, and start thinking remembering that custom can even abrogate the laws of Councils, and is the best interpreter of laws and makes laws. As I said in my post above, I can only trust what I have been told when I inquired. It is extremely unhealthy, arrogant and misplaced for a layman to jump to accusing any of these priests of disobedience. If you go to a Mass where the 2nd confiteor is done, inquire if you must, but don’t presume that your amateur reading of rubrics is the end all and be all of how things are to be done. Or else get rid of processional crosses, using more than one server at a low Mass and various other things that are clearly customs against the rubrics.\\nI do not claim to know with certitude that every use of the 2nd confiteor is legitimate. But it is not my worry or concern. I do know that both the SSPX and FSSP do it only where the congregation expects it….and considering that custom arises from the ground up, is not imposed by a priest and can gain the force of law even when against a law (depending on the case) I hesitate to censure anyone. The FSSP claims that Ecclesia Dei greenlighted this policy (see ). Perhaps they are lying. But that would be presumption to assume that. And again, rubrics are not like American law. Say the black, do the red has its use, but law in the Catholic sense is rooted in custom and not merely the vis verborum. For instance, a single genuflection is prescribed at benediction, but no one sane would rebuke a double genuflection there. Again, before the modifications of the GIRM in recent memory, we had the 1973 GIRM and against the rubric of that GIRM we continued kneeling after the Agnus Dei…Rome’s response? Perfectly alright to do! Heck, the new rubric is to bow (when standing) before receiving. But genuflection is fine ()\\nThe short shrift: liturgical law, like any law really, is not just “black and red” in that what is “red” is in part determined, expanded, etc by custom\\nBTW, the SSPX originally did not do the 2nd Confiteor. They bowed to the custom of places where they were establishing their apostolates.\\nIt is extremely unhealthy, arrogant and misplaced for a layman to jump to accusing any of these priests of disobedience.\\nNot if that layman is being advised by very senior liturgical Ph.D’s, fella.\\nAnd please recall that one CAN licitly judge actions. When I see you fatally shoot your mother, I can say, with no hesitation, that you murdered your mother. There may be mitigating circumstances, but it doesn’t change the fact.\\nThe FSSP says they have a letter from E.D. allowing their variation. I’m willing to believe that. But that letter does NOT apply to others–and since we can’t see the letter, we don’t even know if it applies only to that particular parish, or to the FSSP in general, or to the FSSP only in the US.\\nWho are you calling fella? Please sir, do not presume you are talking to an uneducated dolt. If letters after a name count, I am not without them.\\nPhD’s in liturgy? I know a few myself (well more accurately S.T.L and S.T.D’s with a liturgical/sacramental theology emphasis). But most liturgists I know tend to think “traditional = bad” and also tend to have a very American understanding of the law. Note you have not addressed the issue of custom, which makes, abrogates and interprets laws. Church law is not as prescriptive as modern law.\\nThe fact is you have admitted, you do not know. So please stop calumny. You have not seen that letter right…maybe it lays down a general principle, may not. Who knows? I do not. But neither do you. And if it is a personal rescript one can possibly argue they would get the same response (assuming similar circumstances) and act on it. Who are you to say it does not apply? Church law is, despite its codification, not yet modern, despite your protestations.\\nAnd again, do you work at suppressing having two servers at low Mass? Not only is that against the rubrics, but on several occasions (e.g. 1953) the SRC reprobated the use of more than one with certain exceptions. There you have a clear and unequivocal abuse. Now go at it and foam at the mouth and cry abuse. Take away those processional crosses, and tackle servers that carry the thurible during the recessional and fight against all those horrendous abuses.\\nWhat no? No one cares about the fact that those practices are contra rubricam? Instead they like to attack only the issue of the second confiteor? Why is that?\\nCustom?\\nIt is clear that in the vast majority of the cases here and abroad, “custom” has nothing to do with it.\\nYou claim that “custom” is in place when the EF was not celebrated for 30 (or more) years. Well, OK. Then perhaps the custom of celebrating Mass on the hood of a Jeep for armed forces should be revived. It’s only been in dis-use since the end of the Korean War, after all.\\nCurious that you crusade against one “custom”–that of using 2 altar servers–while frothing and spittle-spewing over those who are disturbed by another “custom.”\\nCalumniator, indeed.</td>\n",

Clutch: Old Navy (Old) Sunnies: Bleu Dame\\nNeutrals are an integral part of every girls wardrobe due in part to the fact that they can mix and match with almost every item in your closet including each other. Colors are fun and indeed an essential, but without a few key neutral pieces, you'll continually find yourself surrounded by bright colors that lack basic styling links, which will leave your wondering why you have nothing to wear. By properly stocking your wardrobe with a few neutral pieces your styling options will instantly double. If you’re a color fiend you can think of these pieces as the perfect canvas for showing off one of your prized bright colored pieces such as a neon pink scarf or a mint green clutch. When styling your neutral ensembles I always suggest adding some contrast and dimension by incorporating tonal textures like eyelet shorts or a crochet vest. Khaki, cream, white, blush, brown, black, and grey are a few of the most popular neutrals..\\nBelow are some of my favorite neutral pieces that are perfect for incorporating into your summer wardrobe:\\n1. Pleated Top 2. Sheer Maxi Skirt 3. Embroidered Scarf\\nAbsolutely love this look!!\\nBooks in my bags\\nFACEBOOK FAN PAGE\\nI like the idea of creating contrast by buying textured neutrals. I think crochet and lace are awesome textures to have in a neutral color as they spice up any wardrobe. Thanks for the tips!\\nso cute sweetheart!\\nI just love the skirt!\\nThe skirt is to die for! And I've been wearing my hair the same way! It's my favorite quick, stylized hair do!\\nCarly\\nAdorable! Love the skirt!\\nThank you for the tips, Anna, you look stunning in your neutrals!

photo, and I liked that blouse so much I bought it from her store!\\nI generally aim for a high degree of original content on this blog, but I really enjoyed rounding up my favourite summer outfits from some of my favourite bloggers in September, and couldn't resist doing an autumn roundup too. However, I've gone a bit overboard, so I'm splitting this post in two. This week you get the vibrant colours and sunny days outfits that most inspired me, next week a few more from the more wintry side of autumn. Since I featured my winter coat last post, and am basically wearing it all the time now, I guess autumn is truly over, in London at least...\\nI Want Your Dress:\\nfrom Yeye! Style Blog and Resplendent Tranquility\\nThis was the year the Alexa Chung collection for Madewell had us all pining for black velvet dresses with little collars. Seeing Izzie's vintage example, I was inspired to spend hours of my life trawling Etsy for weeks, instead of spending too much money, and I'm very happy with the result. I also love her styling of it.\\nYou can't see it well in the picture, but Emily from Resplendent Tranquility's dress has a pattern of chickadees! How perfect for autumn. I skulked around in H&M for quite a while in search of this, but fortunately for my budget they didn't have my size. And I could never have mustered up such a perfect location for it anyway!\\nColoured Denim:\\nfrom Orchid Grey and My Little Fashion Diary\\nAfter I bought my red Zara jeans I was pleased to see other bloggers following me on the coloured denim idea! ; ) Joking aside, red and yellow are probably the best autumn colours around, and I love the difference in the way they've been styled: sort of grunge-folk on Julie and classic all the way on Emilie. And both with truly great shoes...\\nCaitlin in Yellow\\nfrom Waking Life\\nI honestly think Caitlin from Waking Life is one of the most stylish girls in blogland, and she made me doubly despairing of my own dressing abilities all fall by consistently wearing my favourite colour so perfectly. If you don't know her blog already, you should: head over for one perfectly put together look after another, and most of them taken before she goes to work, which just boggles my mind!\\nI Just LIke These Ones:\\nfrom Waking Life and Birds Closet\\nMore perfect looks with oatmeal and red, and also demonstrating that sometimes hair is the best accessory. Well, hair and a swallow-shaped brooch, if you can swing it.\\nKeeping Cozy:\\nfrom Wish Wish Wish and Hannah and Landon\\nCarrie's yellow coat set me back ages in my own coat shopping. I couldn't come to grips with the fact that I wasn't going to find the very one and make it mine.\\nHannah's sweater looks warm too, but what really keeps me cozy is the picture itself. Taken during Canadian Thanksgiving, it reminded me in all the best possible ways of my favouritest of favourite holidays.\\nAny favourites among these? Or what were your favourite colours/looks this fall?\\n49 comments:\\nLove finding new blogs. Thanks for pointing me toward Waking Life. I can't wait to check it out.\\nAlso the last pic/ensemble from Hannah and Landon is possibly my favorite.\\nLeaving the House in THIS?!?!\\nYayy I love all these!!

I think my favorites are the last two photos. I love the yellow jacket paired with the brown polka dot dress - those aren't colors I would usually put together but they looked wonderful that way. I would wear the outfit next to her in a heartbeat. I too am often really inspired by my fellow bloggers, and we all appreciate the recognition, which is why I wanted to say \"thank you\" for stopping by my blog and leaving a message!\\nLove,\\nHeather\\nagreed! red and yellow are two of the best autumn colours, together with dark green I may add :)\\nmy favourite from these: Carrie, Emily and Orchid Grey!\\nThe polka dot is my best pick - of course I will take that yellow coat too...\\nColorful outfits!!!\\nSo nice of you to introduce other bloggers in your blog!!! :)\\nOffice Outfit - 20\\nTrichy Temple Tour - Part 2\\nthese pictures are so good. i had never heard of waking life, but wow that yellow dress!!! amazing. thanks :)\\nI love you blog! and you are so cute\\nThese outfits are all so lovely!

       "2  From a reader:\\nI am a lay Catholic and over the month past month I have felt truly\\nhome since going to the Mass of the Ages.\\nPlease forgive my ignorance but the missal of blessed John XXIII has\\nomitted the prayers at the foot of the altar at certain occasions and\\nthe 2nd confiteor before reception of the Eucharist of the faithful.\\nAre these changes though indiscernible harmful to the faith or\\nnecessary and part of the organic growth of the Mass?\\nThe 1962 Missale Romanum (the Missal of John XXIII) did not omit the prayers at the foot of the altar, except in the normal circumstances (e.g., Good Friday). And there is a curtailed form in the Requiem Mass.\\nHowever, the 1962MR does not have the 2nd Confiteor before Holy Communion. In many places, I would guess most places, it is done anyway regardless.\\nI don’t think it is harmful to the faithful to omit the 2nd Confiteor. It is not harmful to the faithful to be without the prayers at the foot of the altar.\\nAt the same time, consider that these two elements of the older, traditional form of Mass were omitted in the Novus Ordo even though the Second Vatican Council’s document on liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium said that no changes should be made unless it should be for the true good of the faithful.\\nI cannot quite make out how the faithful benefit from the removal of those things. They might not necessarily be harmed, but… how do they benefit?\\nSurely you jest, Father.\\nI don’t think there was any intention to change only what the good of souls demanded. This becomes blatantly obvious when you begin to itemize the changes and ask, “how were these so harmful that it was necessary to remove them?”\\n- the dates (and celebration) of most feast days\\n- the elimination of ember days\\n- the greatest majority of the texts of the Mass\\n- the elimination of minor orders and their roles in the liturgy\\n- the prayers at the foot of the altar\\nAnd this list could go on for quite a long time. Remember folks, Bugnini was largely responsible for the document Sacrosanctum Concilium itself, and he knew what the bishops needed to read to get signatures — and he knew how far his ambiguous document could be stretched.\\nRe: the second Confiteor\\nA very good priest explained in a class on liturgy a couple of years ago (FSSP), that the second Confiteor was really for the congregation to confess one more time in humility, hoping for the forgiveness of our sins to prepare for Holy Communion. He stressed that we should be saying the Confiteor to ourselves with the altar servers, who are speaking in our name before the “Domine non sum dignus” for the congregation. There is nothing more beautiful, moreover, than the Deacon and Sub-Deacon at a Solemn High Mass, going to either side of the altar, bowing low as the Deacon chants the Confiteor. It is such a beautiful chant. I often find myself chanting it when I’m driving in the car – a little odd maybe – but we can’t confess enough, can we?\\nAt our Latin Masses, no matter which one of the four priests come to say the EF, (not a parish, but assigned priests), all four say the second Confiteor. These priests went to St. John Cantius to learn the EF several years ago. Is this ok? As they all do it, I assumed that is what they were taught to do.\\ncomes not come-sorry\\nIt would be helpful to know WHY there was a second Confiteor in the first place.\\nUntil Pius X encouraged more frequent Communion just over a century ago, Communion of the Faithful was less common. When it was done, it would often occur after Mass. This ritual would begin with the recitation of the Confiteor by the server, followed by the priest holding up the Host for the “Ecce Agnus Dei …” much as would be done in the pre-1962 form of the Traditional Mass. It was not considered part of the Mass proper. In fact, you will not find the Communion of the Faithful in the priest’s missal at the altar, even in the 1962 version. And in most comprehensive hand missals until the late 1950s (Dom Gaspar’s Saint Andrew Missal, etc), it is listed as a separate event in an appendix, in addition to its location in the Mass.\\nAnd so, once the Sacrament was more commonly received, the entire ritual was simply inserted after the Communion of the Priest as the norm. Thus the appearance of the “second Confiteor.”\\nThe “second Confiteor” is not in the 1962 Missal, but its continued use is indulged by the Holy See. That it is not officially included, cannot be definitively attributed to any one person, other than perhaps the Holy Father himself, who ultimately approved the change. In all likelihood, it was removed simply because it no longer served its original purpose. On the other hand, a tradition often retains its value after its purpose has faded away. The case could be made either way, without the usual conspiracy theories.\\nAt the parish where I am MC, we do not use it, but its use is brought to the attention of servers in training, and they are told what to do and when, in the event that their experience takes them elsewhere.\\nMe, I could go either way with it.\\nI’m curious about our other readers — how many recite the 2nd Confetior quietly to themselves when it is not recited publically??\\nI must confess that I also say it before receiving Comminion in the Ordinary Form.\\nAt my parish’s EF Masses the servers do not say the 2nd confiteor. I do, however, say the confiteor to myself (followed by a few “SHJ, have mercy…”) as I am in line at the communion rail.\\nI find that it is a great way to bring clarity to the situation.\\nI have said it from the time I was Confirmed (1951) along with the alter boys, if the Pope wanted it there I see no right reason to eliminate it.\\nBeing a humble theology student still grappling with the complexities of the pre-novus ordo form(s) of the Mass, I may be about to put my foot in my mouth.\\nI would probably guess the second confiteor was originally the equivalent (along with the other prayers around it of the Eastern Communion Prayer said in the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. This prayer is a confession of our sins, our unworthiness to receive, and a beseeching of God to heal us.\\nOne could say that in the western rite, it has now been lessened to “O Lord, I am not worthy to receive you, but only say the word and I shall be healed.”\\nWith these thoughts in mind, I wouldn’t say that the loss of the second confiteor is harmful in that it does not diminish the action of the sacrifice and we strive to retain it’s sense with “O Lord, I am not worthy…”. I would say, however, that its loss does not maximize the experience of mercy and gift that should accompany reception of the Eucharist. Acknowledging one’s sinfulness in a dramatic way (like the Eastern Communion Prayer) is a sure way to instill in a person the need for examination of conscience and the reminder that receiving unworthily could lead to judgment or condemnation makes one understand the gravity of the sacrament.\\nHearing it in a Ruthenian Rite scared the crud out of my mother, born and raised Roman Catholic.\\nSo I don’t think it’s loss is harmful. However, I think its addition, or a prayer akin to it (Eastern Communion Prayer), can do great good.\\nFr., I believe the questioner had in mind the various omissions of the prayers at the Foot that were indeed novel ommissions. You say normal, but what is that?\\nIt was not omitted on Palm Sunday, Candlemas, etc until the reform in the 1950′s\\nAnyhow the 2nd or 3rd Confiteor makes perfect sense to me in light of the historical fact that the confiteor at the beginning is not about the people. The priest confesses, then the other sacred ministers confess. These confessions, like the rest of the prayers at the foot, evolved as prayers said to fill in the time of the introit. Only in a roundabout way, via low Mass, is the idea instilled that it is somehow a confession of the congregation. The original purpose was a confession before entering “in sanctum sanctorum”\\nNow especially at a sung or Solemn Mass, the 2nd Confiteor is very significant. The people do not hear the earlier ones and, in fact, can be singing the Introit. But this confiteor is explicitly for them. That it was imported a long time go (before Pius X, before Trent in fact) into the Mass from communion given outside of Mass is also true of the Ecce Agnus Dei (which mimics the Agnus Dei) and the Domine non sum dignus following that (mimicking the priest)\\nThe Dominican Rite prior to 1958 did not even have the Ecce Agnus Dei. Very simply the priest receives communion, and has his own Domine non sum dignus, and then proceeds to distribute.\\nSo that it was imported in does not mean that its purpose does not make sense, any more than with the Ecce Agnus Dei\\n\\\\I am a lay Catholic and over the month past month I have felt truly\\nhome since going to the Mass of the Ages.\\\\\\nAnd just what are the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and other Eastern Liturgies, to say nothing about the other authorized Western rites, such as the Mozarabic, Bragan, and even Novus Ordo?\\nChopped liver?\\nThere was a time that NONE of these liturgies, including the Tridentine Rite, existed, therefore NONE of them can justly be called “the Mass of the Ages”–unless ALL of them (including the Pauline Mass) are.\\nWhat Manwithblackhat said about the second (or possibly third) Confiteor is historically true.\\nAs far as frequently repeating this prayer on the grounds that “one can never confess enough,” it can be a symptom of spiritual OCD, otherwise known as scrupulosity.\\nSooner or later we have to get our eyes off ourselves and onto God’s forgiveness.\\nOne does wonder how Bugnini got away with all he did, and over and over one asks why Paul VI signed off on the N.O.????\\nSince the N.O. is the primary Mass I attend accept for a E.F. Mass once a month, an act of Contrition is the prayer one tries to use prior to receiving Our Lord. but food for thought will now start on my own and quietly saying the confiteor to myself.\\nI can think of a reason why it should be omitted: accusations of disobedience.\\nFor years the 1962 Missal was fought to be “freed” (as popular parlance spoke of the matter). Now that it is “freed” people are not even following its rubrics.\\nFor the sake of consistency of argument, the 2nd confiteor ought not be said.\\n-KJS\\ngloriainexcelisdeo — You reminded me of something I’ve been meaning to ask. Does anyone who is familiar with the FSSP’s custom of having the deacon and subdeacon chant the last (2nd/3rd depending on how you count it) Confiteor before communion at High Mass know how that started? The only time it should be chanted (according to my books) is at a pontifical High Mass.\\nI think it’s noteworthy that Psalm 42 and not the “prayers at the foot of the altar” is what is really in question. This psalm was really a part of the celebrants preparation for Mass and was inserted into the public prayer of the church in the Missal of Trent. The historic liturgies of religious orders (Dominican & Carmelite) do not have this psalm. It was simply the In nomine… Confiteor…kyrie. The Introit is out of place in all of the rites as it ended up right smack in the middle of penitential stuff?! I think “they” tried to fix this. Many orthodox liturgists saw the fault in this. The confiteor before communion is simply out of place too. All the penetential stuff was done at the beginning then we abruptly go back to the confiteor?! All that being said, I wouldn’t say that these things were harmful for anyone.\\n@Fr. Basil,\\n)….\\nIMHO, it’s not an “either/or” matter – either focusing upon ourselves, or focusing upon God.\\nInstead, it is the Catholic “both/and” – looking at all things realistically – the reality of how sinful we truly are AND how much they truly do offend God infinitely, no matter how “small” they might be – as well as realizing that if we express heartfelt contrition for our sins & aim to make amendment in our lives, God will always extend to us His Mercy and forgiveness.\\nI agree with Fr. Z – taking out the 2nd Confiteor was NOT clearly beneficial for the laity.\\nPax et benedictiones tibi, per Christum Dominum nostrum,\\nSteve B\\nPlano, TX\\nThat’s always been my question with the way the new Mass is celebrated (not necessarily how it appears in the missal itself). There are so many things that are optional that “liturgists” choose not to do it simply because they don’t see the point. There is no consideration for any theological reasons other than it’s optional, so why do it at all? Instead, they just add in things or omit what is not optional, thus making it harmful.\\nI am surprised that others have experienced FSSP priests incorporating this confiteor–at the parish I attended for about two years, I never saw it done. As far as how we benefit from the removal of this confiteor: I don’t know what the benefit necessarily is one way or the other. But, now that it is removed, there is a benefit in simply, obediently doing what’s in the book.\\nFr. Z: Doing something “for the true good of the faithful” is one reason changes could be made to the liturgy, but I don’t believe it is the only reason. Sacrosanctum Concilium cited other reasons, such as securing the full and active participation of the people (#14), or if something is shown to be an intrusion which does not harmonize with the inner nature of the liturgy (#21), impedes the faithful from understanding the rites with ease (#21), or is not part of an organic growth when the liturgy is seen historically (#23). In addition, in the revision of the rites, SC calls for a careful investigation into structure and meaning of each part of the liturgy, as well as what is learned from experience of the indults of the Holy See.\\nIf we were to simply go by what is for the “true good of the faithful” almost anything could be inserted into the liturgy. As a rite that communicates grace from outward signs, and signs which must be clear and simple, the liturgy must not present signs which are not merely emotionally fulfilling. What does this part of the Mass do, or accomplish? Is the rite doing this, or have other goals and desires crept in to this part? Is the introductory rite of the Tridentine Mass also the priest’s preparation, and also his contrition of sin, and also the contrition of the ministers, and also the Kyrie, and also the adoration of the Gloria, plus an entrance antiphon (Introit) stuck in between, plus other prayers of humility while kissing the altar, plus, plus, plus ???? So exactly what is this first part of the Mass supposed to accomplish? And if some of these parts were inserted in the 4th, 5th, or 6th centuries, for what reason, and was it true organic growth.\\nThe comment I hear from people in these blogs is “but I feel good when the 2nd confiteor is done. They should never have changed it.” That may sound like a defense of tradition, but it could also be very much a parroting of the liberals’ mindset that we keep things in the liturgy because they feel good. And if that’s the case let’s just ignore the fact that the Missal has dropped the 2nd confiteor, because we don’t have to go along with any change that we don’t agree with. For instance, “The English translation should not be changed, because I feel better with the present translation.”\\nThe second paragraph above should state: “If we were to simply go by what is for the “true good of the faithful” almost anything could be inserted into the liturgy, or allowed to remain there unchanged. As a rite that communicates grace from outward signs, and signs which must be clear and simple, the liturgy must not present signs which are merely emotionally fulfilling.”\\nI was trained as an altar server in 1956. At that time, I was told that the server’s Confiteor at the foot of the altar was the server’s confession and that the server’s Confiteor before communion was done as the people’s representative and that it was important to keep this in mind. Therefore, when the Confiteor before communion was eliminated, I was scandalized and lost much sleep over it. Was I no longer fulfilling my mission of representing the people? Now, perhaps what I was taught was the personal theology of the nun who instructed me and had no basis in fact. I didn’t now that then and I don’t know it now. All I know is that without the pre-communion Confiteor, something doesn’t seem right and no matter how much theologising I hear against it, that doesn’t change my feelings. That said, of course, this should not be all about my feelings, and I agree. I’m just saying it was all very hard on a 14-year-old boy who loved the Mass.\\n“As far as frequently repeating this prayer on the grounds that “one can never confess enough,” it can be a symptom of spiritual OCD, otherwise known as scrupulosity.\\nSooner or later we have to get our eyes off ourselves and onto God’s forgiveness.”\\nThere is nothing scrupulous about not being able to confess enough and knowing this. There is everything scrupulous about not really believing it. That is the peculiar pride of the scrupulous conscience. After all, it is precisly the realization of not being able to accuse ourselves enough, I’m speaking about a true realization rooted in humilty, that propels us forward in the hope of God’s Mercy. Without this it is nothing but presumption.\\nA Legitimate Liturgist priest-scholar (who gave a conference on Chant at which I met the most wonderful Fr. Z) holds that the ‘third Confiteor’ is a vestige–as Mr. Man With Black Hat notes above.\\nBut there’s a bit more than his explanation.\\nYears ago, in a tradition going back many MORE years, a number of the Faithful would arrive at the early weekday Mass just in time for Communion. They were called “daily Communicants.” (Yes, I’m old enough to remember them, including being able to name several from my home parish..) Don’t ask me how that started, or why. I don’t know.\\nAnyhoo, that ‘third Confiteor’ was there for them, too.\\nNow, few (if any) people are “daily communicants” in that way; most are able to attend the entire Mass.\\nAs to B-16 “indulging” the practice: I’d be very interested in seeing documentation of that claim.\\nFinally, it is supremely ironic that a certain Order of priests (based offshore) demands–and I mean DEMANDS–obedience from the laity on issues large and small–yet flagrantly and knowingly DIS-obeys the 1962 Rubrics on this matter.\\nSome things never change.\\nFr. Sotelo wrote: “The comment I hear from people in these blogs is ‘but I feel good when the 2nd confiteor is done. They should never have changed it.’”\\nThat is not what I am seeing from people above. I am reading many comments about the liturgical point of the 3rd/final Confiteor: that is, it is the one for the people receiving communion. Not for the priest (1st Confiteor) and not for the server (2nd Confiteor). So if there is a congregation to receive communion, the final Confiteor is said with the final absolution. If not, then no. Archbishop Bugnini did not give a reason when he hacked off that prayer — he did so without sufficient explanation, so now we have the mess to clean up.\\nAs an aside I find it interesting that most traditional Latin Masses that have a priest who will not allow the 3rd/final Confiteor still recite the Prayers After Low Mass. If you’re going to do one, do both — they were each deleted in the same Bugnini package. The latter, however, features the congregation making vocal responses, my guess as to why more liberally-minded TLM priests are apt to keep them while scrapping the final Confiteor.\\nWhen my family attended the Indult Mass in my youth, the priest followed the rubrics for the 1962 missal so there was no 3rd Confiteor. If the Confiteor before Communion was for the people (as some have stated), it makes sense that it would be omitted at some point during the liturgical renewal of the 20th century. No matter how the Confiteor became part of the prayers at the foot of the altar, by the 1960′s, hand missals and textbooks and the example of the Dialogue Mass had taught the laity that the altar boy’s Confiteor was their Confiteor too. If Rome has given permission for the insertion of the 3rd Confiteor in the 1962 Missal, great. If not, please don’t do it because some of us don’t like illicit practices, even in the name of tradition.\\n//…some of us don’t like illicit practices…//\\nAlice: From my reading of Fr. Z’s comments and the comments of other contributors, it seems that the situation is not one of illicitness but of allowing something that is not explicitly forbidden. If the final Confiteor was explicitly forbidden, then it would be illicit – but it doesn’t sound to me like it’s explicitly forbidden. It may merely be regarded as irregular, but acceptable. For example, if I intentionally start a fire in a restaurant I would violate the law. But, there are many other things I could do in a restaurant that would not be illegal but would also not be acceptable. Just as there are things that are not explicitly allowed by the law that are, nonetheless, perfectly acceptable. Perhaps Fr. Z will clarify.\\nNot for the priest (1st Confiteor) and not for the server (2nd Confiteor).\\nThe altar servers, like the choir, are representatives of the faithful. The confiteor that they say during the Prayers at the foot of the altar are said on behalf of the people AND for themselves.\\nis not one of illicitness but of allowing something that is not explicitly forbidden\\nSay the black, do the red.\\nWhat Jesuit school trained you?\\nThe latest fashion from our NO pastor is to leave out the first Confiteor….\\nwolfeken: There is in the sacred liturgy a communal prayer led by the priest, acting in the person of Christ but also acting on behalf of the members of the Church, which is directed to the praise and glory of the Father in the power of the Holy Spirit. During certain parts of the Mass, the Church asks the people to actively join in, and at other parts to allow the priest alone to speak on behalf of the people through Christ, with Him, and in Him.\\nIn Sacrosanctum Concilium, the Church asks that all the prayers recited by the priest be seen as prayers on behalf of the people, not “his prayers, the servers’ prayers, the servers’ or priest’s prayers on behalf of the people.” The liturgy is not meant to be chopped up into compartments which certain people posses as their special property. So technically, we only need one confiteor, and one of everything else.\\nAs far as the Low Mass prayers, those are not part of the liturgy and are not relevant to a discussion of rubrics, per se. In the 1962 Missal, it is not required to follow Low Mass with the Leonine prayers, but since Mass is finished at that point, the priest and people are free to engage in any devotional actions they may wish without violating any Mass rubric. The Church encourages, outside of Mass, any and all devotional prayers, including the reciting of the Leonine prayers. On the other hand, the pre-Communion Confiteor is part of rubrics within the Mass, and the insistence on including it is a violation of the rubric. I don’t know why we must dispense ourselves from “Say the black, do the red” at this part of the liturgy but not others. It is very simple. The priest and servers at Mass should not be doing what is not prescribed.\\nFather Z wrote, “However, the 1962MR does not have the 2nd Confiteor before Holy Communion. In many places, I would guess most places, it is done anyway regardless.”\\nI do believe this is the case, as I attend the EF at a FSSP parish and the Confiteor is always there before Holy Communion. At every FSSP Mass I’ve ever been to, in fact, this has been the case.; the commenter did not say anything about other Western Liturgies or about the Eastern Liturgies. Certainly other approved liturgies are worthy of our attention, but isn’t it okay to prefer one Rite over another? Especially if the preferred Rite is a commonly accepted Rite of the region where one lives, and more importantly, if the preferred Rite is celebrated in the parish or diocese where one lives? Additionally, the title “the Mass of the Ages” has, for quite some time, been understood to refer to the EF form of the Mass.\\nPretty good discussion here.\\nAs a member of a Schola, I find myself grateful every week for the Confiteor before Holy Communion. Why? During the 1st confiteor, I’m busy singing either an Introit or a Kyrie, so the extra recollection is very helpful.\\nChris\\nSeveral things,\\n1. I do not know what the current status of the prayers after low Mass are, but in 1962 they were no optional. They could, however, be omitted in certain cases (when the Mass is followed by Benediction or a procession, when a sermon is given, when the Mass is celebrated with more solemnity-e.g. a nuptial Mass, etc). This at least is what the most recent edition of Fortescue-O’Connell-Reid states, as well as the Ceremonies of the Mass by O’Connell\\n2. The FSSP follows a very simply rule in general here. Where it was retained as custom, the 2nd/3rd confiteor is said in their Masses. Where it was not so retained they do not re-introduce it. Hence the different experiences of different people\\n3. Wolfeken- assuming the 3rd Confietor is still allowed in 1962, it is certainly permissible to chant it. The rubrics do not direct this, but custom sanctions it. We make a mistake when we read rubrics as if they were American laws. For instance, according to the rubrics a processional cross is used only in Pontifical Masses and a few Masses a year (e.g. Palm Sunday). Yet in English speaking countries the use of such a cross is common place. Or again, according to the rubrics the bell at Mass is rung a) at the sanctus, b) sometime shortly before the consecration c) either once continually, or three times for each elevation. d) Shortly before communion to single to the faithful who may wish to receive to come up. The exact manner (e.g. at the Hanc Igitur) is not determined, and custom admits a variety of other rings.\\nTo all- In the Ceremonies of the Roman Rite, Canon O’Connell has an excellent chapter on rubrics and custom. Read it before you start accusing priests of disobedience. Or else get equally worked up about a processional cross being used, the omission of the Sanctus candle, or the use of more than one server at low Mass of a priest (actually that last one was reprobated several times by the SRC, who allowed the use of more than one only when there was a just cause)\\n4. As a point of fact, it is not disobedience to have the 3rd Confiteor. I wrote the Society of St. John Cantius about this (and have talked to various priests, e.g. Fr. Berg, FSSP). Fr. Scott Haynes, SJC gave me this.\\nNow I would like to see said copy of the SCR decree and obviously can only trust that what this priest wrote me is true, but I think it is downright scandalous and indeed the utmost disrespect to the priests of the FSSP or ICR to call them disobedient. You would have to claim also that priests of the SCJ, FSSP, et al. are liars. It may well be legitimate to wonder about how this works, to ask a priest if he can show you where permission is had or point you in the right direction, etc. But to jump to, as many com-box attackers have here, accusations of disobedience is abhorrent\\nTo clarify: what I have been told by the FSSP is that they were given permission for it where it was still customary upon their arrival (whether that means a pre-existing Latin Mass group, or, as with the SCJ, it was done in the 1960′s I do not know). My understanding is that they don’t want to “rock the boat” too much with communities that expect it.\\nI use my father’s 1954 missal at Mass, and expected the 2nd Confiteor – and I got it at the regular Friday Mass I attend. I did notice one week when I forgot the Missal, that it was not in the LMS version. I also saw it at the FSSP Masses.\\nI like it, because I am occasionally prone to distraction and thus venial sin at Mass, that I love to feel that I am confessing and receiving absolution quietly at the point I have finally decided to receive Communion. I am not over-scrupulous – it just feels right.\\nI\\nOf course, our priest simply removes the first confiteor from our O.F. Mass and dispenses with the whole problem…\\n\\\\)….\\\\\\nIn the Apostles’ Creed, it says, “I believe in the forgiveness of sins…..” Does that not mean we are required to believe that (should the spiritual conditions be met) our sins are forgiven?\\n*; **\\nIt is one thing to love or prefer one particular rite and spiritual tradition of the Church. I make no secret that I love the Byzantine tradition. This does not mean I do not respect the other authorized Liturgies of the Church, and assist at them as I am able.\\nHowever, I have noticed that aficionados of the Extraordinary Form frequently use the term “mass of the/all ages” to assert that is it somehow inherently superior to the Ordinary Form, if not all the other authorized Eucharistic Liturgies as well. In my experience, many of such people have not even HEARD that there are Eastern Liturgies, or even non-Roman Western liturgies, but are merely using “mass of the/all ages” in a triumphalist way.\\nOthers labor under the mistaken and outdated notion that the Roman Rite somehow has some kind of pre-eminence or priority or perfection, and the more an Eastern liturgy is assimilated to it, the more “perfect” it is.\\nIt seems there is plenty of reason to say that the 2nd/3rd Confiteor is legitimate. The Leonine prayers are basically a “prescribed” devotional, but I don’t see why we do not just keep them going. I do not see any reason to throw around terms like “disobedient” and so forth. It is especially quite beautiful at a Solemn High Mass.\\nAs to the other liturgies and the “Mass of the Ages”, at least in my experience, other TLM fans also appreciate the other traditional liturgies-East and West. However, it is just the way it is that the Latin Rite has the preeminence in that it is the most wide spread. When most people think “Catholic” they think of the Roman Rite. Even in the secular world, when they want to paint something as Catholic (especially in film) it is often in varying degrees of the pre-Vatican II Roman trappings. Its basically shorthand to speak of all things Roman as preeminently Catholic, inaccurate yes, but resonate with lived collective experience.\\nMuch thanks for the original post and all of the comments.\\nI recently moved to a parish which includes a traditional Latin Mass in its Sunday Mass schedule. Having grown up with the Latin Mass (Vatican II began when I was in grade school), I was very pleased to dig out my old Latin-English missal again. But I was really puzzled by the “extra” Confiteor right before Communion. I had never experienced that before. So I was really wondering what was up.\\nIt’s nice to have some of the historical background now.\\nDear Joshua08:\\nThank you for your contribution on the last confiteor; it ought to be more widely known.\\nSincerely,\\nJohn Pepino\\nWhen the Confiteor was dropped as part of Blessed John XXIII’s revised rubrics in 1960, permission was given shortly after by the Sacred Congregation of Rites to continue the second Confiteor, where it was an established custom.\\nFine, assuming that there WAS such a custom, uninterrupted. And I’m sure you can supply a citation, which would be interesting for all parties.\\nBut when it is re-instated despite strict obedience to the 1962 rubrics (from 1962-200X), the argument from “custom” is void. That is a case, by the way, with which I am intimately familiar. (The disobedience extends to using the “Benedicamus Domino” at all Masses during Lent and Advent, another practice which was deleted, and there are other seriously questionable practices which I won’t discuss here.)\\nThen we have ‘disobedience’, plain and simple.\\nAnd if one digs around enough, one discovers that the 3rd Confiteor had been dropped (de facto) in most cases because there WAS NO celebration of the EF from ~1969 to ~2000. How can one claim “uninterrupted custom” with a 30-year gap?\\nThe origin of the practice was thoroughly explained above–which also thoroughly explains the reason(s) it was dropped. (See Black Hat’s entry.)\\nThe Roman Ritual as late as 1964 still provides for the use of the Confiteor before the reception of Holy Communion by the faithful as an option\\nThat was covered under my entry for “Daily Communicants” who did NOT attend the entire Mass.\\nYou’re applying legislation to the wrong case.\\ndad29: Very good point. A custom is something that should endure for years, and yet if the EF has been gone all those years in most communities, how can one claim a “custom” as reason to continue the confiteor right before Communion?\\nBeyond the issues of “oh well, it’s already a custom here” or “we don’t want to confuse the faithful” there is the tendency of priests to simply do what they wish to do at the liturgy. This is actually not willful disobedience. It is simply a tendency of many priests, both liberal and traditionalist, to do things during Mass that they sincerely believe are for the good of the faithful and fall under “epikeia” or prudential judgment. The thinking is to make up your mind on a liturgical practice, and then build a theological or legal rationalization around it, or find refuge in obscure indults, special permissions, etc. I find that disagreeable, but that is simply how priests tend to think when they deal with liturgical practices which they feel like/insist on doing.\\nDad29,\\nI believe that the SSPX has reinserted the pre-Communion Confiteor since their founding, so in some places it is “established custom.” If a priest in union with the local bishop offers the EF in a place where the SSPX has been established for a while, I can see why Rome might have given permission for this priest to reinsert this Confiteor. I just don’t know that Rome HAS given such permission and without it, it should not be done.\\nFr. Basil,\\nThank you for not ascribing to malice would could be ascribed to ignorance, but I am not sure that is always (or even often) the case. I can still get worked up about one book I read by a Latin Rite triumphalist who argued that since the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom was only published 10 years before the Council of Trent, it didn’t fall under the established tradition exception or remembering how our priest told us that there were no rubrics in the Divine Liturgy so the priest was even freer to do whatever he wanted than in the Novus Ordo. Many people are ignorant about the different variants of the Western Mass, which are older than the Mass which Abp. Lefebvre called the “Mass of All-Time” but at least in the circles I found myself there was an active dislike for the non-Latin liturgies.\\nThis is actually not willful disobedience. It is simply a tendency of many priests, both liberal and traditionalist, to do things during Mass that they sincerely believe are for the good of the faithful and fall under “epikeia” or prudential judgment.\\nYes, well….\\nSometimes that ‘confiteor’ issue is part of a larger pattern of willful deviations from established norms, in which case(s) “closing one’s eyes” is imprudent–and people are obligated to speak out.\\nI understand “pastoral” considerations. But at the same time, expecting the laity to live to standards and at the same time being a bit………flaccid……..seems to me to be a dangerous path. Which rules are to be obeyed? Which are to be gently ignored?\\nAnd no, I’m not talking “salvation is at risk” here, but still……VatII places very great weight on the Mass.\\ndad29: And therein lies the controversy over the pre-Communion confiteor. There is an unspoken assumption in the EF Mass world that the present Magisterium should indeed be gently ignored, at times, in matters regarding the liturgy. To repeat a favorite mantra of many people, “the novus ordo is a big joke. What right do novus ordo hierarchy and priests have to question the Mass of the Ages?” Of course, Fr. Z doesn’t tolerate that disrespect in his blog, but it doesn’t mean that many folks do not quietly think that way towards the present Magisterium.\\nI can understand why the FSSP would gravitate to reciting the last confiteor. The SSPX recite the pre-Communion confiteor, and for many they are still the true standard of what is Catholic. And sad to say, the FSSP is at times dogged with the accusation that they are not really as Catholic as the SSPX, that they are compromised, watered down, and not as free as SSPX to be true defenders of tradition. That is not my opinion, by the way; I deeply admire the FSSP. But if the FSSP tell their priests to not recite the pre-Communion confiteor, it does leave them vulnerable to the accusation that they are indult wannabees who are prepared to act just like the “indult priests” who are not true priests but “presbyters.” In some ways, reciting the pre-Communion confiteor is a way to say, “see, we still offer a true Catholic Mass.”\\nI still don’t buy, Joshua08, the argument that custom allows the final Confiteor to be sung in a non-pontifical High Mass. The missal is very clear as to what is sung and what is not. And it (or the Pontificale Ceremoniale) very clearly says the final Confiteor is to be sung at a pontifical High Mass.\\nIf a “custom” arises to sing this pontifical privilege at a regular High Mass, then what is to stop a “custom” of singing the final blessing?\\nAs far as those who claim the traditional Latin Mass was “gone” from 1969 to 2007′ish, it is possible that it was gone from your world, but recall the people who worked to get the 1970 Agatha Christie indult, the JPII 1984/88 indults and the Benedict motu proprio have been saying/hearing this Mass validly in one location or another non-stop. Please don’t assume the Mass magically re-started when you attended the novus ordo. To that end, it absolutely makes sense to say the old SCR permission for a final Confiteor still applies.\\nIn some ways, reciting the pre-Communion confiteor is a way to say, “see, we still offer a true Catholic Mass.”\\nUmnnhhh….see today’s post on this very blog.\\n.\\n—wherein “he” is B-16, speaking to the Bishops of Italy.\\nThere is no real dilemma here, just as there is no ‘dilemma’ in stating that “He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood…”. Either take it or leave it. There was no ‘pastoral shimmy’ in those words, good Father.\\nBy the way, I’m sure you’ve noticed that no one has YET come up with a citation “indulging” this practice. Moreover, it is irrelevant what SSPX does or did. Their abuse of the Liturgy cannot license another abuse of the Liturgy, can it?\\nAh, well.\\nThis video from the 1940′s shows the chanting of the 2nd confiteor. I again urge that people pick up a copy of O’Connell (pre-1962 versions are at least online) and read what he says of custom. Try to stop thinking like a modern about prescriptive law, and start thinking remembering that custom can even abrogate the laws of Councils, and is the best interpreter of laws and makes laws. As I said in my post above, I can only trust what I have been told when I inquired. It is extremely unhealthy, arrogant and misplaced for a layman to jump to accusing any of these priests of disobedience. If you go to a Mass where the 2nd confiteor is done, inquire if you must, but don’t presume that your amateur reading of rubrics is the end all and be all of how things are to be done. Or else get rid of processional crosses, using more than one server at a low Mass and various other things that are clearly customs against the rubrics.\\nI do not claim to know with certitude that every use of the 2nd confiteor is legitimate. But it is not my worry or concern. I do know that both the SSPX and FSSP do it only where the congregation expects it….and considering that custom arises from the ground up, is not imposed by a priest and can gain the force of law even when against a law (depending on the case) I hesitate to censure anyone. The FSSP claims that Ecclesia Dei greenlighted this policy (see ). Perhaps they are lying. But that would be presumption to assume that. And again, rubrics are not like American law. Say the black, do the red has its use, but law in the Catholic sense is rooted in custom and not merely the vis verborum. For instance, a single genuflection is prescribed at benediction, but no one sane would rebuke a double genuflection there. Again, before the modifications of the GIRM in recent memory, we had the 1973 GIRM and against the rubric of that GIRM we continued kneeling after the Agnus Dei…Rome’s response? Perfectly alright to do! Heck, the new rubric is to bow (when standing) before receiving. But genuflection is fine ()\\nThe short shrift: liturgical law, like any law really, is not just “black and red” in that what is “red” is in part determined, expanded, etc by custom\\nBTW, the SSPX originally did not do the 2nd Confiteor. They bowed to the custom of places where they were establishing their apostolates.\\nIt is extremely unhealthy, arrogant and misplaced for a layman to jump to accusing any of these priests of disobedience.\\nNot if that layman is being advised by very senior liturgical Ph.D’s, fella.\\nAnd please recall that one CAN licitly judge actions. When I see you fatally shoot your mother, I can say, with no hesitation, that you murdered your mother. There may be mitigating circumstances, but it doesn’t change the fact.\\nThe FSSP says they have a letter from E.D. allowing their variation. I’m willing to believe that. But that letter does NOT apply to others–and since we can’t see the letter, we don’t even know if it applies only to that particular parish, or to the FSSP in general, or to the FSSP only in the US.\\nWho are you calling fella? Please sir, do not presume you are talking to an uneducated dolt. If letters after a name count, I am not without them.\\nPhD’s in liturgy? I know a few myself (well more accurately S.T.L and S.T.D’s with a liturgical/sacramental theology emphasis). But most liturgists I know tend to think “traditional = bad” and also tend to have a very American understanding of the law. Note you have not addressed the issue of custom, which makes, abrogates and interprets laws. Church law is not as prescriptive as modern law.\\nThe fact is you have admitted, you do not know. So please stop calumny. You have not seen that letter right…maybe it lays down a general principle, may not. Who knows? I do not. But neither do you. And if it is a personal rescript one can possibly argue they would get the same response (assuming similar circumstances) and act on it. Who are you to say it does not apply? Church law is, despite its codification, not yet modern, despite your protestations.\\nAnd again, do you work at suppressing having two servers at low Mass? Not only is that against the rubrics, but on several occasions (e.g. 1953) the SRC reprobated the use of more than one with certain exceptions. There you have a clear and unequivocal abuse. Now go at it and foam at the mouth and cry abuse. Take away those processional crosses, and tackle servers that carry the thurible during the recessional and fight against all those horrendous abuses.\\nWhat no? No one cares about the fact that those practices are contra rubricam? Instead they like to attack only the issue of the second confiteor? Why is that?\\nCustom?\\nIt is clear that in the vast majority of the cases here and abroad, “custom” has nothing to do with it.\\nYou claim that “custom” is in place when the EF was not celebrated for 30 (or more) years. Well, OK. Then perhaps the custom of celebrating Mass on the hood of a Jeep for armed forces should be revived. It’s only been in dis-use since the end of the Korean War, after all.\\nCurious that you crusade against one “custom”–that of using 2 altar servers–while frothing and spittle-spewing over those who are disturbed by another “custom.”\\nCalumniator, indeed.   \n",

    "\n",
    "RefinedWeb, having undergone Macro Data Refinement (MDR), provides a high-quality, large-scale web dataset suitable for training and fine-tuning transformer-based models such as GPT, BERT, and RoBERTa. Since these models rely on rich linguistic structure—including punctuation, casing, and diverse expressions—**only minimal and structure-focused preprocessing** is appropriate.\n",

       "      <td>In 1995 fresh out of college I walked into our sales office at Lazzara Yachts. It’s not where I would be allowed to start my boating career, first I had to work in the factory, but it was where I wanted to ultimately end up. I was introduced to all the staff and given and overview of what each person did. The position I was most interested in was Marketing &amp; Sales. So on that day I spent a bit of extra time with our VP of Sales. He showed me a ton of stuff but in particular introduced me to this incredible technology called the BUC system. It was this amazing system that had a list of most of the used yachts that were for sale. You could look up everything and get all kinds of information on boats all around the world. This system was revolutionary and dam expensive. For $15k you got the computer and the rights to access everything and we had one. I couldn’t have been more excited. I could just see it. Clients would come to our office and we would sit down with them and preview all these boats for sale without having to drive to see every single one. Surely this was going to be the future of yacht sales.\\nExcept it wasn’t.\\nThat same year a little known company launched a website called Yachtworld.com and BUC along with the rest of the industry ignored it. After all BUC was the well respected, originator that had been the “bible” of boat sales since 1961. Combined with the yacht brokers community these new comers will never be a threat to how boats are sold.\\nUntil it was.\\nIn 2019 you will find nearly 100,000 listings on Yachtworld and over 130,000 listings on Boats.com which bought Yachtworld in 2000. No other boat listing system comes close to the collective power of these services and brands. They have won the end user when it comes to finding boats for sale via search and that is a very dangerous position to be in if you are in sales.\\nDon’t believe me? Just watch whats happened to Realestate and you can get a preview of where we are headed. Everyone knows Zillow today but when they started in 2009 no one, especially Realtors, could have predicted where the industry would be at in less than 10 years. Today Zillow has won the end user. Today agents are at the mercy of Zillow to produce leads. Today after a decade of giving Zillow all the information agents must look back and think, “what the hell just happened?”\\nIt’s going to happen to us.\\nAs of today Yachtworld has not implemented a pay per lead program such as Zillows. However tomorrow they will. The purchase of Yachtcloser last year is a subtle step in that direction. Yachtworld is building a database that knows every buyer, every seller, the exact selling price, I mean EXACT, and a list of other valuable, detailed, accurate information. So imagine you were the leading brand with consumers searching to buy a boat and could now offer them information such as previous sale price, previous days on market, noted deficiencies on any conditional acceptances, and the list goes on. If you don’t think they will you are kidding yourself. Zillow always promised the agents that Zillow just a marketing company and they would never compete against agents for commissions. Until Opendoor and iBuyer programs came along. Now Zillow buys houses with their ZillowOffers program. Today Zillow utilizes an agent when completing a ZillowOffers transaction. One that is part of their preferred paying agent network therefore insuring agents still get a commission. However how long can that last when Opendoor is a brokerage house and cuts listing fees by 50%. How long until Zillow becomes a brokerage and buys and sells without any agents involvement? It’s coming sooner than you think.\\nStop being so negative.\\nThe good news is that our industry is much slower moving with far far fewer transactions. So perhaps Yachtworld won’t buy and sell yachts someday thus cutting out salesmen. Perhaps they wont even do a pay per lead program. Maybe all that transactional data that they are collecting will simply sit on servers never to be aggregated and disseminated. However I’m not betting my next 20 years in this industry on presuming any of that.\\nSo what should we do?\\nFocus on the consumers needs and build your personal brand. The one advantage you have over any company, service or brokerage house is your ability to create relationships with clients. Your ability to be a person and not just a brand gives you a huge advantage in the coming decades. Today’s tools available to you from companies such as Linked In, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. give you a leg up insuring your don’t become the next BUC of the industry. The biggest mistake you could make is to blow these tools off as silly social sites that people go on to talk about their pets, bitch about their problems, promote themselves and give political opinions.

Future Value Interest Factor: FVIF(i, n). Financial Problems and Analysis . Appendix B. Future Value Interest Factor: FVIF(i, n).\\nTo set up the rules, select a cell or range and then click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the ribbon.\\nAdditionally, fvof need to specify the Type argument to the function. This will launch the following dialog box:. You can see how the rules are created.\\nAlso, we don’t need to see the number in A For the second rule we want to apply a border to the right edge of column A, but only those rows that are supposed to be visible in the table. The third rule will hide everything outside of the visible part of the table as defined by the values in B5: In the Type edit box, enter “Period” include the fivf marks.\\nSubstituting 1 for FV, fif for N, and 0.\\nFuture Value of $1 Table\\nIf you change to an annuity due in B7 then, for reference, you should get 1. Then you have to interpolate because 3. But what happens if the interest rate is 3.\\nFor example, we don’t want them to enter a negative interest rate in B1. Let’s take care of a couple of simple items first. Click B7 and then the Data Validation button. They must be formulas that will evaluate to either True or False. Go to the Number tab and choose the Custom category. If you change the value in B1, for example, then the interest rates in the table will change, and the interest factors will be recalculated as well.\\nTo create the data table we need to select A Our PVIF table will serve as a template for each of the other three tables. Be sure to click the Create a Copy box at the bottom of the dialog box. Select the entire table A The PVIF is 0.\\nTime Value of Money Tables in Excel |\\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how to create these tables using Excel. For reference, if you change B7 to an annuity due you should get 1.\\nClick the OK button to apply the custom number format. In this case, the table provides a factor that is multiplied by a future value of a lump sum cash flow in order to obtain its fviv value.\\nFuture Value Factor Calculator\\nNote that we still need slightly different formulas, depending on the type of annuity as described above. Note that the PV function is only used in the upper-left corner of fcif table. We need to add 1 to the number of columns because we are including column A, which is not a part of the 30 columns specified.\\nVirtually every finance textbook has, at the back, a series of tables that contain multipliers that can tble used to easily calculate present or future values without the need for a financial calculator. Apply a format with a border on the right edge only, and set the font to bold. The key to creating the tables is to understand that they are all based upon the basic time value of money formulas.\\nYou can also create a one-input data table by specifying only the row or column input cell, but that wouldn’t suit the purpose here. Formatting isn’t just for making your spreadsheet pretty.\\nFor the interest rate we want to allow any decimal number between 0 and 0. Excel does this repeatedly to fill in the table.</td>\n",

       "      <td>.\\nOnly in her teens did Natalie begin to rebel, insisting on trying out for a role in the offbeat film “Rebel Without a Cause.” Unlike the cinematic antihero so memorably played by her co-star James Dean, Natalie had good cause to rebel, especially after her mother broke up her first serious romance with a high school sweetheart. (Maria had no such objections when her 16-year-old daughter spent unchaperoned nights with Hollywood VIPs.) Yet, for all the reasons she had to resent her mother, Natalie also recognized how much she owed her.\\nSuzanne Finstad, a lawyer and magazine writer whose previous books include a true-crime story, “Sleeping With the Devil,” and a biography of Priscilla Presley, presents a poignant, intensely sympathetic portrait of the vulnerable, sensitive little girl who grew up to be the quintessential Hollywood star, swathed in sable or mink, never seen in public without her makeup. Yet, as Finstad shows us, there was another side to Natalie: She wanted to become a serious actress, not just a star, and to this end she sought out opportunities to work with directors like Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, actors like James Dean and Scott Marlowe. “On the surface,” writes Finstad, “Natalie’s life seemed like a Sandra Dee movie fantasy of a teenage star ... in her cotton-candy-pink bedroom filled with toy tigers--gifts from male admirers.” Yet a lot of her private time was spent reading books like Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” the kind of books she would have read had she enjoyed the benefits of a college education.\\nAlmost everyone who came into contact with Natalie (and Finstad has interviewed hundreds of them--childhood friends, actors, directors, costume designers, hairstylists) seems to have been impressed, not only by her intelligence and professionalism, but by her genuine sweetness. One of the few people who refused to be interviewed was Natalie’s husband, Robert Wagner. Finstad paints quite an insightful portrait of their relationship nonetheless. Only as the story moves toward its tragic conclusion do things grow murky. Natalie’s 1981 death by drowning in the waters off Catalina on a boating excursion with her husband and her co-star Christopher Walken on Thanksgiving weekend still remains something of a mystery. Finstad offers detailed accounts of the testimony of various witnesses--waitresses, a bartender, restaurant patrons, people in a nearby boat, and, most troubling of all, the man who captained the Wagners’ vessel--to what was clearly a strained, unpleasant weekend in which huge quantities of alcohol were consumed. What seems clear from Finstad’s account is that when faced with a genuine emergency Wagner’s first instinct was to be more afraid of negative publicity than of losing his wife. And the flight from truth rippled outwards. In time-hallowed Hollywood fashion, make-believe triumphed over reality.</td>\n",

There are 2 opinions on the matter of Plus Size Fashion and I happen to agree with both!\\nLast night, I caught Trinny and Susannah’s ‘Undress The Nation’ on ITV1, which this week was focused around the fashion options available to plus size women. You have to say plus size really, you can’t get away with fat, obese or unhealthy on TV. Don’t get me wrong, I myself am certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, skinny; in fact, a couple more dress sizes and I’ll be limited to ‘larger lady’ collections too. So, you see, its not like I’m trying to be biased or offensive…the difference is, I’m also not trying to say I’m normal or ‘fabulous’, as one women kept repeating on last nights show. I am overweight and unhealthy and I, granted, most of the time do not look good in current fashions! So what should I do? Should I stick to the dreaded ‘tent tops’ and wide leg trousers, should I wedge myself into a white pair of skinny jeans and deal with my highlighted lumps and bumps in the name of fashion…or maybe I should just lose some weight? No real answer to this question was truly given last night – possibly, because there is no answer or possibly, because ITV was too afraid of offending someone, who knows.\\nTrinny and Susannah have their heart in the right place (I’m a big fan, actually); they tried to get some young designers from the London College of Fashion to create their ‘big girl’ models some fashionable, flattering clothing, but I have to say they failed. All that was really offered were a few square neck pencil dresses in different colours, primarily of the same design. I don’t want to wear that every day either, thanks.\\nThe retailers did their bit and joined in on the debate; Elvi and Evans turned up, as expected, along with a small number of representatives from other retailers such as Monsoon, but most were defensive about their collections and decision to stop at a size 16.\\nEven the retailers who offered an 18 and above got criticism; it was suggested that simply making one design in a wide range of sizes wasn’t enough and it should be adapted for the larger ladies unique figure.\\nOne representative (from a retailer whose name I’ve forgotten, I think it was Zara) said it would take a whole new design, a whole new template and a completely separate production line to do this…so, a whole separate retail operation then? Like, maybe, Evans (part of Arcadia), for example?\\nI agree here that it really isn’t financially viable for the majority of fashion stores who already make quite enough money serving “size 10 freaks” (the [irresponsible] words of a woman on the show, not mine!) to add bigger sizes, and you have to wonder if getting the retailers to make bigger clothes is really the way forward. I don’t think it is. How about getting people to loose some weight?!\\nI know that there are legitimate reasons for obesity and I know that it’s bloody hard to shed the pounds, but trust me – and this is from one who knows – you’ll feel much better getting into that Topshop size twelve than if you had stayed big and waited for the Topshop ‘Big Is Beautiful’ collection*.\\nYou might look alright in plus size clothing, but (and this is purposefully clichéd) you really won’t feel alright on the inside, and that’s what really matters.\\n*not a real collection!\\nAs with everything these days it seems the endorsement by a 'celebrity' would encourage the customer to buy into a certain line, so if a popular retailer were to launch a plus size range then the use of someone such as Nigella who is both beautiful and glamourous as well as on the large size to endorse the product, should help sales; equally advice on how to dress the fuller figure would have more credibility if it were delivered by someone larger rather than coming from Trinny and Susannah. Also it is not enough to add plus sizes to the current ranges, but to reshape fabrics into new looks would encourage the customer to feel they were still buying into the trend rather than being forced into Evans or other speciality retailers. It's not rocket science to take an existing garment and modify the look for a larger figure, increase the length, reshape the neck slightly, there's definitely scope for that and using the same fabrics and modifying the styling is a lot less expensive for the retailer than launching a whole new range. From the customer's perspective it might make you feel better to fit into a Top Shop size 12 than than waiting for the plus size range but if you are large and have no chance of shifting the weight then the reality is that being fashionable and having a good body image is going to be about compromise.\\nPosted By Anne | 20 August 2008 13:06 PM\\nHi Frances. You're right, there is a massive market waiting to be tapped, which I'm sure the retailers will eventually pick up on...it might just take some time! Remember what happened with ecommerce? Only a year ago the number of retailers with websites was unerwhelming, now, ecommerce is making up a large proportion of sales for most of them; the industry does catch up eventually, it just takes a while!\\nPosted By Lorraine | 18 August 2008 09:33 AM\\nQuite frankly I'm surprised the retailers aren't leaping over each other to cater for the plus sizes. We keep being told there's an obesity crisis, so presumably the number of people requiring larger clothes is growing. It's unlike the retailers to deny themselves a great big slice of any market. It makes me wonder what their resaoning would be. What is more powerful than making themselves even more money? It must be the association. They must rather be associated with the \"size 10 freaks\" and fear an association with anyone much larger would actually deny them the skinnier market instead. Presumably there will be a tipping point when the size of the plus size market can no longer be ignored.\\nPosted By Frances | 14 August 2008 18:20</td>\n",

It’s not where I would be allowed to start my boating career, first I had to work in the factory, but it was where I wanted to ultimately end up. I was introduced to all the staff and given and overview of what each person did. The position I was most interested in was Marketing & Sales. So on that day I spent a bit of extra time with our VP of Sales. He showed me a ton of stuff but in particular introduced me to this incredible technology called the BUC system. It was this amazing system that had a list of most of the used yachts that were for sale. You could look up everything and get all kinds of information on boats all around the world. This system was revolutionary and dam expensive. For $15k you got the computer and the rights to access everything and we had one. I couldn’t have been more excited. I could just see it. Clients would come to our office and we would sit down with them and preview all these boats for sale without having to drive to see every single one. Surely this was going to be the future of yacht sales.\\nExcept it wasn’t.\\nThat same year a little known company launched a website called Yachtworld.com and BUC along with the rest of the industry ignored it. After all BUC was the well respected, originator that had been the “bible” of boat sales since 1961. Combined with the yacht brokers community these new comers will never be a threat to how boats are sold.\\nUntil it was.\\nIn 2019 you will find nearly 100,000 listings on Yachtworld and over 130,000 listings on Boats.com which bought Yachtworld in 2000. No other boat listing system comes close to the collective power of these services and brands. They have won the end user when it comes to finding boats for sale via search and that is a very dangerous position to be in if you are in sales.\\nDon’t believe me? Just watch whats happened to Realestate and you can get a preview of where we are headed. Everyone knows Zillow today but when they started in 2009 no one, especially Realtors, could have predicted where the industry would be at in less than 10 years. Today Zillow has won the end user. Today agents are at the mercy of Zillow to produce leads. Today after a decade of giving Zillow all the information agents must look back and think, “what the hell just happened?”\\nIt’s going to happen to us.\\nAs of today Yachtworld has not implemented a pay per lead program such as Zillows. However tomorrow they will. The purchase of Yachtcloser last year is a subtle step in that direction. Yachtworld is building a database that knows every buyer, every seller, the exact selling price, I mean EXACT, and a list of other valuable, detailed, accurate information. So imagine you were the leading brand with consumers searching to buy a boat and could now offer them information such as previous sale price, previous days on market, noted deficiencies on any conditional acceptances, and the list goes on. If you don’t think they will you are kidding yourself. Zillow always promised the agents that Zillow just a marketing company and they would never compete against agents for commissions. Until Opendoor and iBuyer programs came along. Now Zillow buys houses with their ZillowOffers program. Today Zillow utilizes an agent when completing a ZillowOffers transaction. One that is part of their preferred paying agent network therefore insuring agents still get a commission. However how long can that last when Opendoor is a brokerage house and cuts listing fees by 50%. How long until Zillow becomes a brokerage and buys and sells without any agents involvement? It’s coming sooner than you think.\\nStop being so negative.\\nThe good news is that our industry is much slower moving with far far fewer transactions. So perhaps Yachtworld won’t buy and sell yachts someday thus cutting out salesmen. Perhaps they wont even do a pay per lead program. Maybe all that transactional data that they are collecting will simply sit on servers never to be aggregated and disseminated. However I’m not betting my next 20 years in this industry on presuming any of that.\\nSo what should we do?\\nFocus on the consumers needs and build your personal brand. The one advantage you have over any company, service or brokerage house is your ability to create relationships with clients. Your ability to be a person and not just a brand gives you a huge advantage in the coming decades. Today’s tools available to you from companies such as Linked In, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. give you a leg up insuring your don’t become the next BUC of the industry. The biggest mistake you could make is to blow these tools off as silly social sites that people go on to talk about their pets, bitch about their problems, promote themselves and give political opinions. Yeah sure this is going on, but make no mistake about it, these platforms work to gain trust, sell yourself and get clients.\\nAfter 23 years of doing this there is one thing I know. Nothing stays the same forever. Which means we shouldn’t either. There is a storm coming now is the time to prepare.   \n",

You can also use the future value factor table to find the value of future value factor.

Financial Problems and Analysis . Appendix B. Future Value Interest Factor: FVIF(i, n).\\nTo set up the rules, select a cell or range and then click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the ribbon.\\nAdditionally, fvof need to specify the Type argument to the function. This will launch the following dialog box:. You can see how the rules are created.\\nAlso, we don’t need to see the number in A For the second rule we want to apply a border to the right edge of column A, but only those rows that are supposed to be visible in the table. The third rule will hide everything outside of the visible part of the table as defined by the values in B5: In the Type edit box, enter “Period” include the fivf marks.\\nSubstituting 1 for FV, fif for N, and 0.\\nFuture Value of $1 Table\\nIf you change to an annuity due in B7 then, for reference, you should get 1. Then you have to interpolate because 3. But what happens if the interest rate is 3.\\nFor example, we don’t want them to enter a negative interest rate in B1. Let’s take care of a couple of simple items first. Click B7 and then the Data Validation button. They must be formulas that will evaluate to either True or False. Go to the Number tab and choose the Custom category. If you change the value in B1, for example, then the interest rates in the table will change, and the interest factors will be recalculated as well.\\nTo create the data table we need to select A Our PVIF table will serve as a template for each of the other three tables. Be sure to click the Create a Copy box at the bottom of the dialog box. Select the entire table A The PVIF is 0.\\nTime Value of Money Tables in Excel |\\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how to create these tables using Excel. For reference, if you change B7 to an annuity due you should get 1.\\nClick the OK button to apply the custom number format. In this case, the table provides a factor that is multiplied by a future value of a lump sum cash flow in order to obtain its fviv value.\\nFuture Value Factor Calculator\\nNote that we still need slightly different formulas, depending on the type of annuity as described above. Note that the PV function is only used in the upper-left corner of fcif table. We need to add 1 to the number of columns because we are including column A, which is not a part of the 30 columns specified.\\nVirtually every finance textbook has, at the back, a series of tables that contain multipliers that can tble used to easily calculate present or future values without the need for a financial calculator. Apply a format with a border on the right edge only, and set the font to bold. The key to creating the tables is to understand that they are all based upon the basic time value of money formulas.\\nYou can also create a one-input data table by specifying only the row or column input cell, but that wouldn’t suit the purpose here. Formatting isn’t just for making your spreadsheet pretty.\\nFor the interest rate we want to allow any decimal number between 0 and 0. Excel does this repeatedly to fill in the table.   \n",

(Maria had no such objections when her 16-year-old daughter spent unchaperoned nights with Hollywood VIPs.) Yet, for all the reasons she had to resent her mother, Natalie also recognized how much she owed her.\\nSuzanne Finstad, a lawyer and magazine writer whose previous books include a true-crime story, “Sleeping With the Devil,” and a biography of Priscilla Presley, presents a poignant, intensely sympathetic portrait of the vulnerable, sensitive little girl who grew up to be the quintessential Hollywood star, swathed in sable or mink, never seen in public without her makeup. Yet, as Finstad shows us, there was another side to Natalie: She wanted to become a serious actress, not just a star, and to this end she sought out opportunities to work with directors like Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, actors like James Dean and Scott Marlowe. “On the surface,” writes Finstad, “Natalie’s life seemed like a Sandra Dee movie fantasy of a teenage star ... in her cotton-candy-pink bedroom filled with toy tigers--gifts from male admirers.” Yet a lot of her private time was spent reading books like Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” the kind of books she would have read had she enjoyed the benefits of a college education.\\nAlmost everyone who came into contact with Natalie (and Finstad has interviewed hundreds of them--childhood friends, actors, directors, costume designers, hairstylists) seems to have been impressed, not only by her intelligence and professionalism, but by her genuine sweetness. One of the few people who refused to be interviewed was Natalie’s husband, Robert Wagner. Finstad paints quite an insightful portrait of their relationship nonetheless. Only as the story moves toward its tragic conclusion do things grow murky. Natalie’s 1981 death by drowning in the waters off Catalina on a boating excursion with her husband and her co-star Christopher Walken on Thanksgiving weekend still remains something of a mystery. Finstad offers detailed accounts of the testimony of various witnesses--waitresses, a bartender, restaurant patrons, people in a nearby boat, and, most troubling of all, the man who captained the Wagners’ vessel--to what was clearly a strained, unpleasant weekend in which huge quantities of alcohol were consumed. What seems clear from Finstad’s account is that when faced with a genuine emergency Wagner’s first instinct was to be more afraid of negative publicity than of losing his wife. And the flight from truth rippled outwards. In time-hallowed Hollywood fashion, make-believe triumphed over reality.   \n",

There are 2 opinions on the matter of Plus Size Fashion and I happen to agree with both!\\nLast night, I caught Trinny and Susannah’s ‘Undress The Nation’ on ITV1, which this week was focused around the fashion options available to plus size women. You have to say plus size really, you can’t get away with fat, obese or unhealthy on TV. Don’t get me wrong, I myself am certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, skinny; in fact, a couple more dress sizes and I’ll be limited to ‘larger lady’ collections too. So, you see, its not like I’m trying to be biased or offensive…the difference is, I’m also not trying to say I’m normal or ‘fabulous’, as one women kept repeating on last nights show. I am overweight and unhealthy and I, granted, most of the time do not look good in current fashions! So what should I do? Should I stick to the dreaded ‘tent tops’ and wide leg trousers, should I wedge myself into a white pair of skinny jeans and deal with my highlighted lumps and bumps in the name of fashion…or maybe I should just lose some weight? No real answer to this question was truly given last night – possibly, because there is no answer or possibly, because ITV was too afraid of offending someone, who knows.\\nTrinny and Susannah have their heart in the right place (I’m a big fan, actually); they tried to get some young designers from the London College of Fashion to create their ‘big girl’ models some fashionable, flattering clothing, but I have to say they failed. All that was really offered were a few square neck pencil dresses in different colours, primarily of the same design. I don’t want to wear that every day either, thanks.\\nThe retailers did their bit and joined in on the debate; Elvi and Evans turned up, as expected, along with a small number of representatives from other retailers such as Monsoon, but most were defensive about their collections and decision to stop at a size 16.\\nEven the retailers who offered an 18 and above got criticism; it was suggested that simply making one design in a wide range of sizes wasn’t enough and it should be adapted for the larger ladies unique figure.\\nOne representative (from a retailer whose name I’ve forgotten, I think it was Zara) said it would take a whole new design, a whole new template and a completely separate production line to do this…so, a whole separate retail operation then? Like, maybe, Evans (part of Arcadia), for example?\\nI agree here that it really isn’t financially viable for the majority of fashion stores who already make quite enough money serving “size 10 freaks” (the [irresponsible] words of a woman on the show, not mine!) to add bigger sizes, and you have to wonder if getting the retailers to make bigger clothes is really the way forward. I don’t think it is. How about getting people to loose some weight?!\\nI know that there are legitimate reasons for obesity and I know that it’s bloody hard to shed the pounds, but trust me – and this is from one who knows – you’ll feel much better getting into that Topshop size twelve than if you had stayed big and waited for the Topshop ‘Big Is Beautiful’ collection*.\\nYou might look alright in plus size clothing, but (and this is purposefully clichéd) you really won’t feel alright on the inside, and that’s what really matters.\\n*not a real collection!\\nAs with everything these days it seems the endorsement by a 'celebrity' would encourage the customer to buy into a certain line, so if a popular retailer were to launch a plus size range then the use of someone such as Nigella who is both beautiful and glamourous as well as on the large size to endorse the product, should help sales; equally advice on how to dress the fuller figure would have more credibility if it were delivered by someone larger rather than coming from Trinny and Susannah. Also it is not enough to add plus sizes to the current ranges, but to reshape fabrics into new looks would encourage the customer to feel they were still buying into the trend rather than being forced into Evans or other speciality retailers. It's not rocket science to take an existing garment and modify the look for a larger figure, increase the length, reshape the neck slightly, there's definitely scope for that and using the same fabrics and modifying the styling is a lot less expensive for the retailer than launching a whole new range. From the customer's perspective it might make you feel better to fit into a Top Shop size 12 than than waiting for the plus size range but if you are large and have no chance of shifting the weight then the reality is that being fashionable and having a good body image is going to be about compromise.\\nPosted By Anne | 20 August 2008 13:06 PM\\nHi Frances. You're right, there is a massive market waiting to be tapped, which I'm sure the retailers will eventually pick up on...it might just take some time! Remember what happened with ecommerce? Only a year ago the number of retailers with websites was unerwhelming, now, ecommerce is making up a large proportion of sales for most of them; the industry does catch up eventually, it just takes a while!\\nPosted By Lorraine | 18 August 2008 09:33 AM\\nQuite frankly I'm surprised the retailers aren't leaping over each other to cater for the plus sizes. We keep being told there's an obesity crisis, so presumably the number of people requiring larger clothes is growing. It's unlike the retailers to deny themselves a great big slice of any market. It makes me wonder what their resaoning would be. What is more powerful than making themselves even more money? It must be the association. They must rather be associated with the \"size 10 freaks\" and fear an association with anyone much larger would actually deny them the skinnier market instead. Presumably there will be a tipping point when the size of the plus size market can no longer be ignored.\\nPosted By Frances | 14 August 2008 18:20   \n",

       "      <td>In 1995 fresh out of college I walked into our sales office at Lazzara Yachts. It’s not where I would be allowed to start my boating career, first I had to work in the factory, but it was where I wanted to ultimately end up. I was introduced to all the staff and given and overview of what each person did. The position I was most interested in was Marketing &amp; Sales. So on that day I spent a bit of extra time with our VP of Sales. He showed me a ton of stuff but in particular introduced me to this incredible technology called the BUC system. It was this amazing system that had a list of most of the used yachts that were for sale. You could look up everything and get all kinds of information on boats all around the world. This system was revolutionary and dam expensive. For $15k you got the computer and the rights to access everything and we had one. I couldn’t have been more excited. I could just see it. Clients would come to our office and we would sit down with them and preview all these boats for sale without having to drive to see every single one. Surely this was going to be the future of yacht sales.\\nExcept it wasn’t.\\nThat same year a little known company launched a website called Yachtworld.com and BUC along with the rest of the industry ignored it. After all BUC was the well respected, originator that had been the “bible” of boat sales since 1961. Combined with the yacht brokers community these new comers will never be a threat to how boats are sold.\\nUntil it was.\\nIn 2019 you will find nearly 100,000 listings on Yachtworld and over 130,000 listings on Boats.com which bought Yachtworld in 2000. No other boat listing system comes close to the collective power of these services and brands. They have won the end user when it comes to finding boats for sale via search and that is a very dangerous position to be in if you are in sales.\\nDon’t believe me? Just watch whats happened to Realestate and you can get a preview of where we are headed. Everyone knows Zillow today but when they started in 2009 no one, especially Realtors, could have predicted where the industry would be at in less than 10 years. Today Zillow has won the end user. Today agents are at the mercy of Zillow to produce leads. Today after a decade of giving Zillow all the information agents must look back and think, “what the hell just happened?”\\nIt’s going to happen to us.\\nAs of today Yachtworld has not implemented a pay per lead program such as Zillows. However tomorrow they will. The purchase of Yachtcloser last year is a subtle step in that direction. Yachtworld is building a database that knows every buyer, every seller, the exact selling price, I mean EXACT, and a list of other valuable, detailed, accurate information. So imagine you were the leading brand with consumers searching to buy a boat and could now offer them information such as previous sale price, previous days on market, noted deficiencies on any conditional acceptances, and the list goes on. If you don’t think they will you are kidding yourself. Zillow always promised the agents that Zillow just a marketing company and they would never compete against agents for commissions. Until Opendoor and iBuyer programs came along. Now Zillow buys houses with their ZillowOffers program. Today Zillow utilizes an agent when completing a ZillowOffers transaction. One that is part of their preferred paying agent network therefore insuring agents still get a commission. However how long can that last when Opendoor is a brokerage house and cuts listing fees by 50%. How long until Zillow becomes a brokerage and buys and sells without any agents involvement? It’s coming sooner than you think.\\nStop being so negative.\\nThe good news is that our industry is much slower moving with far far fewer transactions. So perhaps Yachtworld won’t buy and sell yachts someday thus cutting out salesmen. Perhaps they wont even do a pay per lead program. Maybe all that transactional data that they are collecting will simply sit on servers never to be aggregated and disseminated. However I’m not betting my next 20 years in this industry on presuming any of that.\\nSo what should we do?\\nFocus on the consumers needs and build your personal brand. The one advantage you have over any company, service or brokerage house is your ability to create relationships with clients. Your ability to be a person and not just a brand gives you a huge advantage in the coming decades. Today’s tools available to you from companies such as Linked In, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. give you a leg up insuring your don’t become the next BUC of the industry. The biggest mistake you could make is to blow these tools off as silly social sites that people go on to talk about their pets, bitch about their problems, promote themselves and give political opinions. Yeah sure this is going on, but make no mistake about it, these platforms work to gain trust, sell yourself and get clients.\\nAfter 23 years of doing this there is one thing I know. Nothing stays the same forever. Which means we shouldn’t either. There is a storm coming now is the time to prepare.</td>\n",

This will launch the following dialog box:. You can see how the rules are created.\\nAlso, we don’t need to see the number in A For the second rule we want to apply a border to the right edge of column A, but only those rows that are supposed to be visible in the table. The third rule will hide everything outside of the visible part of the table as defined by the values in B5: In the Type edit box, enter “Period” include the fivf marks.\\nSubstituting 1 for FV, fif for N, and 0.\\nFuture Value of $1 Table\\nIf you change to an annuity due in B7 then, for reference, you should get 1. Then you have to interpolate because 3. But what happens if the interest rate is 3.\\nFor example, we don’t want them to enter a negative interest rate in B1. Let’s take care of a couple of simple items first. Click B7 and then the Data Validation button. They must be formulas that will evaluate to either True or False. Go to the Number tab and choose the Custom category. If you change the value in B1, for example, then the interest rates in the table will change, and the interest factors will be recalculated as well.\\nTo create the data table we need to select A Our PVIF table will serve as a template for each of the other three tables.

       "      <td>.\\nOnly in her teens did Natalie begin to rebel, insisting on trying out for a role in the offbeat film “Rebel Without a Cause.” Unlike the cinematic antihero so memorably played by her co-star James Dean, Natalie had good cause to rebel, especially after her mother broke up her first serious romance with a high school sweetheart. (Maria had no such objections when her 16-year-old daughter spent unchaperoned nights with Hollywood VIPs.) Yet, for all the reasons she had to resent her mother, Natalie also recognized how much she owed her.\\nSuzanne Finstad, a lawyer and magazine writer whose previous books include a true-crime story, “Sleeping With the Devil,” and a biography of Priscilla Presley, presents a poignant, intensely sympathetic portrait of the vulnerable, sensitive little girl who grew up to be the quintessential Hollywood star, swathed in sable or mink, never seen in public without her makeup. Yet, as Finstad shows us, there was another side to Natalie: She wanted to become a serious actress, not just a star, and to this end she sought out opportunities to work with directors like Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, actors like James Dean and Scott Marlowe. “On the surface,” writes Finstad, “Natalie’s life seemed like a Sandra Dee movie fantasy of a teenage star ... in her cotton-candy-pink bedroom filled with toy tigers--gifts from male admirers.” Yet a lot of her private time was spent reading books like Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” the kind of books she would have read had she enjoyed the benefits of a college education.\\nAlmost everyone who came into contact with Natalie (and Finstad has interviewed hundreds of them--childhood friends, actors, directors, costume designers, hairstylists) seems to have been impressed, not only by her intelligence and professionalism, but by her genuine sweetness. One of the few people who refused to be interviewed was Natalie’s husband, Robert Wagner. Finstad paints quite an insightful portrait of their relationship nonetheless. Only as the story moves toward its tragic conclusion do things grow murky. Natalie’s 1981 death by drowning in the waters off Catalina on a boating excursion with her husband and her co-star Christopher Walken on Thanksgiving weekend still remains something of a mystery. Finstad offers detailed accounts of the testimony of various witnesses--waitresses, a bartender, restaurant patrons, people in a nearby boat, and, most troubling of all, the man who captained the Wagners’ vessel--to what was clearly a strained, unpleasant weekend in which huge quantities of alcohol were consumed. What seems clear from Finstad’s account is that when faced with a genuine emergency Wagner’s first instinct was to be more afraid of negative publicity than of losing his wife. And the flight from truth rippled outwards. In time-hallowed Hollywood fashion, make-believe triumphed over reality.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MEMBER'S LOGIN\\nYou are here: Home | Blog | Trinny and Susannah Undress the Obesity Crisis\\nTrinny and Susannah Undress the Obesity Crisis\\nPosted At: 13 August 2008 11:15 AMRelated Categories: General, Retailers\\nThis blog is going to be a bit controversial and a bit undecided, I warn you now. There are 2 opinions on the matter of Plus Size Fashion and I happen to agree with both!\\nLast night, I caught Trinny and Susannah’s ‘Undress The Nation’ on ITV1, which this week was focused around the fashion options available to plus size women. You have to say plus size really, you can’t get away with fat, obese or unhealthy on TV. Don’t get me wrong, I myself am certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, skinny; in fact, a couple more dress sizes and I’ll be limited to ‘larger lady’ collections too. So, you see, its not like I’m trying to be biased or offensive…the difference is, I’m also not trying to say I’m normal or ‘fabulous’, as one women kept repeating on last nights show. I am overweight and unhealthy and I, granted, most of the time do not look good in current fashions! So what should I do? Should I stick to the dreaded ‘tent tops’ and wide leg trousers, should I wedge myself into a white pair of skinny jeans and deal with my highlighted lumps and bumps in the name of fashion…or maybe I should just lose some weight? No real answer to this question was truly given last night – possibly, because there is no answer or possibly, because ITV was too afraid of offending someone, who knows.\\nTrinny and Susannah have their heart in the right place (I’m a big fan, actually); they tried to get some young designers from the London College of Fashion to create their ‘big girl’ models some fashionable, flattering clothing, but I have to say they failed. All that was really offered were a few square neck pencil dresses in different colours, primarily of the same design. I don’t want to wear that every day either, thanks.\\nThe retailers did their bit and joined in on the debate; Elvi and Evans turned up, as expected, along with a small number of representatives from other retailers such as Monsoon, but most were defensive about their collections and decision to stop at a size 16.\\nEven the retailers who offered an 18 and above got criticism; it was suggested that simply making one design in a wide range of sizes wasn’t enough and it should be adapted for the larger ladies unique figure.\\nOne representative (from a retailer whose name I’ve forgotten, I think it was Zara) said it would take a whole new design, a whole new template and a completely separate production line to do this…so, a whole separate retail operation then? Like, maybe, Evans (part of Arcadia), for example?\\nI agree here that it really isn’t financially viable for the majority of fashion stores who already make quite enough money serving “size 10 freaks” (the [irresponsible] words of a woman on the show, not mine!) to add bigger sizes, and you have to wonder if getting the retailers to make bigger clothes is really the way forward. I don’t think it is. How about getting people to loose some weight?!\\nI know that there are legitimate reasons for obesity and I know that it’s bloody hard to shed the pounds, but trust me – and this is from one who knows – you’ll feel much better getting into that Topshop size twelve than if you had stayed big and waited for the Topshop ‘Big Is Beautiful’ collection*.\\nYou might look alright in plus size clothing, but (and this is purposefully clichéd) you really won’t feel alright on the inside, and that’s what really matters.\\n*not a real collection!\\nAs with everything these days it seems the endorsement by a 'celebrity' would encourage the customer to buy into a certain line, so if a popular retailer were to launch a plus size range then the use of someone such as Nigella who is both beautiful and glamourous as well as on the large size to endorse the product, should help sales; equally advice on how to dress the fuller figure would have more credibility if it were delivered by someone larger rather than coming from Trinny and Susannah. Also it is not enough to add plus sizes to the current ranges, but to reshape fabrics into new looks would encourage the customer to feel they were still buying into the trend rather than being forced into Evans or other speciality retailers. It's not rocket science to take an existing garment and modify the look for a larger figure, increase the length, reshape the neck slightly, there's definitely scope for that and using the same fabrics and modifying the styling is a lot less expensive for the retailer than launching a whole new range. From the customer's perspective it might make you feel better to fit into a Top Shop size 12 than than waiting for the plus size range but if you are large and have no chance of shifting the weight then the reality is that being fashionable and having a good body image is going to be about compromise.\\nPosted By Anne | 20 August 2008 13:06 PM\\nHi Frances. You're right, there is a massive market waiting to be tapped, which I'm sure the retailers will eventually pick up on...it might just take some time! Remember what happened with ecommerce? Only a year ago the number of retailers with websites was unerwhelming, now, ecommerce is making up a large proportion of sales for most of them; the industry does catch up eventually, it just takes a while!\\nPosted By Lorraine | 18 August 2008 09:33 AM\\nQuite frankly I'm surprised the retailers aren't leaping over each other to cater for the plus sizes. We keep being told there's an obesity crisis, so presumably the number of people requiring larger clothes is growing. It's unlike the retailers to deny themselves a great big slice of any market. It makes me wonder what their resaoning would be. What is more powerful than making themselves even more money? It must be the association. They must rather be associated with the \"size 10 freaks\" and fear an association with anyone much larger would actually deny them the skinnier market instead. Presumably there will be a tipping point when the size of the plus size market can no longer be ignored.\\nPosted By Frances | 14 August 2008 18:20</td>\n",

It’s not where I would be allowed to start my boating career, first I had to work in the factory, but it was where I wanted to ultimately end up. I was introduced to all the staff and given and overview of what each person did. The position I was most interested in was Marketing & Sales. So on that day I spent a bit of extra time with our VP of Sales. He showed me a ton of stuff but in particular introduced me to this incredible technology called the BUC system. It was this amazing system that had a list of most of the used yachts that were for sale. You could look up everything and get all kinds of information on boats all around the world. This system was revolutionary and dam expensive. For $15k you got the computer and the rights to access everything and we had one. I couldn’t have been more excited. I could just see it. Clients would come to our office and we would sit down with them and preview all these boats for sale without having to drive to see every single one. Surely this was going to be the future of yacht sales.\\nExcept it wasn’t.\\nThat same year a little known company launched a website called Yachtworld.com and BUC along with the rest of the industry ignored it. After all BUC was the well respected, originator that had been the “bible” of boat sales since 1961. Combined with the yacht brokers community these new comers will never be a threat to how boats are sold.\\nUntil it was.\\nIn 2019 you will find nearly 100,000 listings on Yachtworld and over 130,000 listings on Boats.com which bought Yachtworld in 2000. No other boat listing system comes close to the collective power of these services and brands. They have won the end user when it comes to finding boats for sale via search and that is a very dangerous position to be in if you are in sales.\\nDon’t believe me? Just watch whats happened to Realestate and you can get a preview of where we are headed. Everyone knows Zillow today but when they started in 2009 no one, especially Realtors, could have predicted where the industry would be at in less than 10 years. Today Zillow has won the end user. Today agents are at the mercy of Zillow to produce leads. Today after a decade of giving Zillow all the information agents must look back and think, “what the hell just happened?”\\nIt’s going to happen to us.\\nAs of today Yachtworld has not implemented a pay per lead program such as Zillows. However tomorrow they will. The purchase of Yachtcloser last year is a subtle step in that direction. Yachtworld is building a database that knows every buyer, every seller, the exact selling price, I mean EXACT, and a list of other valuable, detailed, accurate information. So imagine you were the leading brand with consumers searching to buy a boat and could now offer them information such as previous sale price, previous days on market, noted deficiencies on any conditional acceptances, and the list goes on. If you don’t think they will you are kidding yourself. Zillow always promised the agents that Zillow just a marketing company and they would never compete against agents for commissions. Until Opendoor and iBuyer programs came along. Now Zillow buys houses with their ZillowOffers program. Today Zillow utilizes an agent when completing a ZillowOffers transaction. One that is part of their preferred paying agent network therefore insuring agents still get a commission. However how long can that last when Opendoor is a brokerage house and cuts listing fees by 50%. How long until Zillow becomes a brokerage and buys and sells without any agents involvement? It’s coming sooner than you think.\\nStop being so negative.\\nThe good news is that our industry is much slower moving with far far fewer transactions. So perhaps Yachtworld won’t buy and sell yachts someday thus cutting out salesmen. Perhaps they wont even do a pay per lead program. Maybe all that transactional data that they are collecting will simply sit on servers never to be aggregated and disseminated. However I’m not betting my next 20 years in this industry on presuming any of that.\\nSo what should we do?\\nFocus on the consumers needs and build your personal brand. The one advantage you have over any company, service or brokerage house is your ability to create relationships with clients. Your ability to be a person and not just a brand gives you a huge advantage in the coming decades. Today’s tools available to you from companies such as Linked In, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. give you a leg up insuring your don’t become the next BUC of the industry. The biggest mistake you could make is to blow these tools off as silly social sites that people go on to talk about their pets, bitch about their problems, promote themselves and give political opinions. Yeah sure this is going on, but make no mistake about it, these platforms work to gain trust, sell yourself and get clients.\\nAfter 23 years of doing this there is one thing I know. Nothing stays the same forever. Which means we shouldn’t either. There is a storm coming now is the time to prepare.\n",

You can also use the future value factor table to find the value of future value factor.

Financial Problems and Analysis . Appendix B. Future Value Interest Factor: FVIF(i, n).\\nTo set up the rules, select a cell or range and then click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the ribbon.\\nAdditionally, fvof need to specify the Type argument to the function. This will launch the following dialog box:. You can see how the rules are created.\\nAlso, we don’t need to see the number in A For the second rule we want to apply a border to the right edge of column A, but only those rows that are supposed to be visible in the table. The third rule will hide everything outside of the visible part of the table as defined by the values in B5: In the Type edit box, enter “Period” include the fivf marks.\\nSubstituting 1 for FV, fif for N, and 0.\\nFuture Value of $1 Table\\nIf you change to an annuity due in B7 then, for reference, you should get 1. Then you have to interpolate because 3. But what happens if the interest rate is 3.\\nFor example, we don’t want them to enter a negative interest rate in B1. Let’s take care of a couple of simple items first. Click B7 and then the Data Validation button. They must be formulas that will evaluate to either True or False. Go to the Number tab and choose the Custom category. If you change the value in B1, for example, then the interest rates in the table will change, and the interest factors will be recalculated as well.\\nTo create the data table we need to select A Our PVIF table will serve as a template for each of the other three tables. Be sure to click the Create a Copy box at the bottom of the dialog box. Select the entire table A The PVIF is 0.\\nTime Value of Money Tables in Excel |\\nThis tutorial will demonstrate how to create these tables using Excel. For reference, if you change B7 to an annuity due you should get 1.\\nClick the OK button to apply the custom number format. In this case, the table provides a factor that is multiplied by a future value of a lump sum cash flow in order to obtain its fviv value.\\nFuture Value Factor Calculator\\nNote that we still need slightly different formulas, depending on the type of annuity as described above. Note that the PV function is only used in the upper-left corner of fcif table. We need to add 1 to the number of columns because we are including column A, which is not a part of the 30 columns specified.\\nVirtually every finance textbook has, at the back, a series of tables that contain multipliers that can tble used to easily calculate present or future values without the need for a financial calculator. Apply a format with a border on the right edge only, and set the font to bold. The key to creating the tables is to understand that they are all based upon the basic time value of money formulas.\\nYou can also create a one-input data table by specifying only the row or column input cell, but that wouldn’t suit the purpose here. Formatting isn’t just for making your spreadsheet pretty.\\nFor the interest rate we want to allow any decimal number between 0 and 0. Excel does this repeatedly to fill in the table.\n",

(Maria had no such objections when her 16-year-old daughter spent unchaperoned nights with Hollywood VIPs.) Yet, for all the reasons she had to resent her mother, Natalie also recognized how much she owed her.\\nSuzanne Finstad, a lawyer and magazine writer whose previous books include a true-crime story, “Sleeping With the Devil,” and a biography of Priscilla Presley, presents a poignant, intensely sympathetic portrait of the vulnerable, sensitive little girl who grew up to be the quintessential Hollywood star, swathed in sable or mink, never seen in public without her makeup. Yet, as Finstad shows us, there was another side to Natalie: She wanted to become a serious actress, not just a star, and to this end she sought out opportunities to work with directors like Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, actors like James Dean and Scott Marlowe. “On the surface,” writes Finstad, “Natalie’s life seemed like a Sandra Dee movie fantasy of a teenage star ... in her cotton-candy-pink bedroom filled with toy tigers--gifts from male admirers.” Yet a lot of her private time was spent reading books like Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” the kind of books she would have read had she enjoyed the benefits of a college education.\\nAlmost everyone who came into contact with Natalie (and Finstad has interviewed hundreds of them--childhood friends, actors, directors, costume designers, hairstylists) seems to have been impressed, not only by her intelligence and professionalism, but by her genuine sweetness. One of the few people who refused to be interviewed was Natalie’s husband, Robert Wagner. Finstad paints quite an insightful portrait of their relationship nonetheless. Only as the story moves toward its tragic conclusion do things grow murky. Natalie’s 1981 death by drowning in the waters off Catalina on a boating excursion with her husband and her co-star Christopher Walken on Thanksgiving weekend still remains something of a mystery. Finstad offers detailed accounts of the testimony of various witnesses--waitresses, a bartender, restaurant patrons, people in a nearby boat, and, most troubling of all, the man who captained the Wagners’ vessel--to what was clearly a strained, unpleasant weekend in which huge quantities of alcohol were consumed. What seems clear from Finstad’s account is that when faced with a genuine emergency Wagner’s first instinct was to be more afraid of negative publicity than of losing his wife. And the flight from truth rippled outwards. In time-hallowed Hollywood fashion, make-believe triumphed over reality.\n",

There are 2 opinions on the matter of Plus Size Fashion and I happen to agree with both!\\nLast night, I caught Trinny and Susannah’s ‘Undress The Nation’ on ITV1, which this week was focused around the fashion options available to plus size women. You have to say plus size really, you can’t get away with fat, obese or unhealthy on TV. Don’t get me wrong, I myself am certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, skinny; in fact, a couple more dress sizes and I’ll be limited to ‘larger lady’ collections too. So, you see, its not like I’m trying to be biased or offensive…the difference is, I’m also not trying to say I’m normal or ‘fabulous’, as one women kept repeating on last nights show. I am overweight and unhealthy and I, granted, most of the time do not look good in current fashions! So what should I do? Should I stick to the dreaded ‘tent tops’ and wide leg trousers, should I wedge myself into a white pair of skinny jeans and deal with my highlighted lumps and bumps in the name of fashion…or maybe I should just lose some weight? No real answer to this question was truly given last night – possibly, because there is no answer or possibly, because ITV was too afraid of offending someone, who knows.\\nTrinny and Susannah have their heart in the right place (I’m a big fan, actually); they tried to get some young designers from the London College of Fashion to create their ‘big girl’ models some fashionable, flattering clothing, but I have to say they failed. All that was really offered were a few square neck pencil dresses in different colours, primarily of the same design. I don’t want to wear that every day either, thanks.\\nThe retailers did their bit and joined in on the debate; Elvi and Evans turned up, as expected, along with a small number of representatives from other retailers such as Monsoon, but most were defensive about their collections and decision to stop at a size 16.\\nEven the retailers who offered an 18 and above got criticism; it was suggested that simply making one design in a wide range of sizes wasn’t enough and it should be adapted for the larger ladies unique figure.\\nOne representative (from a retailer whose name I’ve forgotten, I think it was Zara) said it would take a whole new design, a whole new template and a completely separate production line to do this…so, a whole separate retail operation then? Like, maybe, Evans (part of Arcadia), for example?\\nI agree here that it really isn’t financially viable for the majority of fashion stores who already make quite enough money serving “size 10 freaks” (the [irresponsible] words of a woman on the show, not mine!) to add bigger sizes, and you have to wonder if getting the retailers to make bigger clothes is really the way forward. I don’t think it is. How about getting people to loose some weight?!\\nI know that there are legitimate reasons for obesity and I know that it’s bloody hard to shed the pounds, but trust me – and this is from one who knows – you’ll feel much better getting into that Topshop size twelve than if you had stayed big and waited for the Topshop ‘Big Is Beautiful’ collection*.\\nYou might look alright in plus size clothing, but (and this is purposefully clichéd) you really won’t feel alright on the inside, and that’s what really matters.\\n*not a real collection!\\nAs with everything these days it seems the endorsement by a 'celebrity' would encourage the customer to buy into a certain line, so if a popular retailer were to launch a plus size range then the use of someone such as Nigella who is both beautiful and glamourous as well as on the large size to endorse the product, should help sales; equally advice on how to dress the fuller figure would have more credibility if it were delivered by someone larger rather than coming from Trinny and Susannah. Also it is not enough to add plus sizes to the current ranges, but to reshape fabrics into new looks would encourage the customer to feel they were still buying into the trend rather than being forced into Evans or other speciality retailers. It's not rocket science to take an existing garment and modify the look for a larger figure, increase the length, reshape the neck slightly, there's definitely scope for that and using the same fabrics and modifying the styling is a lot less expensive for the retailer than launching a whole new range. From the customer's perspective it might make you feel better to fit into a Top Shop size 12 than than waiting for the plus size range but if you are large and have no chance of shifting the weight then the reality is that being fashionable and having a good body image is going to be about compromise.\\nPosted By Anne | 20 August 2008 13:06 PM\\nHi Frances. You're right, there is a massive market waiting to be tapped, which I'm sure the retailers will eventually pick up on...it might just take some time! Remember what happened with ecommerce? Only a year ago the number of retailers with websites was unerwhelming, now, ecommerce is making up a large proportion of sales for most of them; the industry does catch up eventually, it just takes a while!\\nPosted By Lorraine | 18 August 2008 09:33 AM\\nQuite frankly I'm surprised the retailers aren't leaping over each other to cater for the plus sizes. We keep being told there's an obesity crisis, so presumably the number of people requiring larger clothes is growing. It's unlike the retailers to deny themselves a great big slice of any market. It makes me wonder what their resaoning would be. What is more powerful than making themselves even more money? It must be the association. They must rather be associated with the \"size 10 freaks\" and fear an association with anyone much larger would actually deny them the skinnier market instead. Presumably there will be a tipping point when the size of the plus size market can no longer be ignored.\\nPosted By Frances | 14 August 2008 18:20"

The Bloomberg news service's just-launched daily Billionaires Index calculates the changing market worth of 20 wealthiest individuals. Mr Slim’s net worth fell $US478.4 million in a day to $US68.5 billion as of the close of markets on March 2, when the index was first calculated, but his fortune has increased 11% this year. Mr Gates is worth $US62.4 billion, down $US102.1 million on March 2 and up 11% year to date. Investor and co-philanthropist Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, declined $US336.9 million to $US43.8 billion on March 2 and is up 2.4% in 2012. The combined net worth of the 20 richest people is $US676.8 billion. Nine are Americans, including three from the family of Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores. Three Europeans are ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. Sweden’s Ingvar Kamprad, who is worth $US42.5 billion, controls Ikea Group.

The Bloomberg news service's just-launched daily Billionaires Index calculates the changing market worth of 20 wealthiest individuals. Mr Slim’s net worth fell $US478.4 million in a day to $US68.5 billion as of the close of markets on March 2, when the index was first calculated, but his fortune has increased 11% this year. Mr Gates is worth $US62.4 billion, down $US102.1 million on March 2 and up 11% year to date. Investor and co-philanthropist Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, declined $US336.9 million to $US43.8 billion on March 2 and is up 2.4% in 2012. The combined net worth of the 20 richest people is $US676.8 billion. Nine are Americans, including three from the family of Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores. Three Europeans are ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. Sweden’s Ingvar Kamprad, who is worth $US42.5 billion, controls Ikea Group. Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), has a $US42.3 billion based on his shareholding, while Spaniard Amancio Ortega owns the Zara clothing chain and is worth $US38.8 billion. Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s $US38 billion fortune puts him seventh and $US4 billion ahead of brothers Charles and David Koch, who each own 42% of Koch Industries, a refining and chemical maker. The fastest climber on the list is Brazil’s Eike Batista, who ranks 10th at $US29.8 billion, up $US133.9 million on March 2. His fortune based on investments in iron ore and coal, has grown 32% this year. The top billionaire in the Australasian region is Gina Rinehart, the Australian mining heiress who is worth $US20.4 billion, $US2 billion short of the 20th person on the list, Liliane Bettencourt, heiress to the French Oréal empire.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In 1995 fresh out of college I walked into our sales office at Lazzara Yachts. It’s not where I would be allowed to start my boating career, first I had to work in the factory, but it was where I wanted to ultimately end up. I was introduced to all the staff and given and overview of what each person did. The position I was most interested in was Marketing &amp; Sales. So on that day I spent a bit of extra time with our VP of Sales. He showed me a ton of stuff but in particular introduced me to this incredible technology called the BUC system. It was this amazing system that had a list of most of the used yachts that were for sale. You could look up everything and get all kinds of information on boats all around the world. This system was revolutionary and dam expensive. For $15k you got the computer and the rights to access everything and we had one. I couldn’t have been more excited. I could just see it. Clients would come to our office and we would sit down with them and preview all these boats for sale without having to drive to see every single one. Surely this was going to be the future of yacht sales. Except it wasn’t. That same year a little known company launched a website called Yachtworld.com and BUC along with the rest of the industry ignored it. After all BUC was the well respected, originator that had been the “bible” of boat sales since 1961. Combined with the yacht brokers community these new comers will never be a threat to how boats are sold. Until it was. In 2019 you will find nearly 100,000 listings on Yachtworld and over 130,000 listings on Boats.com which bought Yachtworld in 2000. No other boat listing system comes close to the collective power of these services and brands. They have won the end user when it comes to finding boats for sale via search and that is a very dangerous position to be in if you are in sales. Don’t believe me? Just watch whats happened to Realestate and you can get a preview of where we are headed. Everyone knows Zillow today but when they started in 2009 no one, especially Realtors, could have predicted where the industry would be at in less than 10 years. Today Zillow has won the end user. Today agents are at the mercy of Zillow to produce leads. Today after a decade of giving Zillow all the information agents must look back and think, “what the hell just happened?” It’s going to happen to us. As of today Yachtworld has not implemented a pay per lead program such as Zillows. However tomorrow they will. The purchase of Yachtcloser last year is a subtle step in that direction. Yachtworld is building a database that knows every buyer, every seller, the exact selling price, I mean EXACT, and a list of other valuable, detailed, accurate information. So imagine you were the leading brand with consumers searching to buy a boat and could now offer them information such as previous sale price, previous days on market, noted deficiencies on any conditional acceptances, and the list goes on. If you don’t think they will you are kidding yourself. Zillow always promised the agents that Zillow just a marketing company and they would never compete against agents for commissions. Until Opendoor and iBuyer programs came along. Now Zillow buys houses with their ZillowOffers program. Today Zillow utilizes an agent when completing a ZillowOffers transaction. One that is part of their preferred paying agent network therefore insuring agents still get a commission. However how long can that last when Opendoor is a brokerage house and cuts listing fees by 50%. How long until Zillow becomes a brokerage and buys and sells without any agents involvement? It’s coming sooner than you think. Stop being so negative. The good news is that our industry is much slower moving with far far fewer transactions. So perhaps Yachtworld won’t buy and sell yachts someday thus cutting out salesmen. Perhaps they wont even do a pay per lead program. Maybe all that transactional data that they are collecting will simply sit on servers never to be aggregated and disseminated. However I’m not betting my next 20 years in this industry on presuming any of that. So what should we do? Focus on the consumers needs and build your personal brand. The one advantage you have over any company, service or brokerage house is your ability to create relationships with clients. Your ability to be a person and not just a brand gives you a huge advantage in the coming decades. Today’s tools available to you from companies such as Linked In, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. give you a leg up insuring your don’t become the next BUC of the industry. The biggest mistake you could make is to blow these tools off as silly social sites that people go on to talk about their pets, bitch about their problems, promote themselves and give political opinions. Yeah sure this is going on, but make no mistake about it, these platforms work to gain trust, sell yourself and get clients. After 23 years of doing this there is one thing I know. Nothing stays the same forever. Which means we shouldn’t either. There is a storm coming now is the time to prepare.</td>\n",

To set up the rules, select a cell or range and then click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the ribbon. Additionally, fvof need to specify the Type argument to the function. This will launch the following dialog box:. You can see how the rules are created. Also, we don’t need to see the number in A For the second rule we want to apply a border to the right edge of column A, but only those rows that are supposed to be visible in the table. The third rule will hide everything outside of the visible part of the table as defined by the values in B5: In the Type edit box, enter “Period” include the fivf marks. Substituting 1 for FV, fif for N, and 0. Future Value of $1 Table If you change to an annuity due in B7 then, for reference, you should get 1. Then you have to interpolate because 3. But what happens if the interest rate is 3. For example, we don’t want them to enter a negative interest rate in B1. Let’s take care of a couple of simple items first. Click B7 and then the Data Validation button. They must be formulas that will evaluate to either True or False. Go to the Number tab and choose the Custom category. If you change the value in B1, for example, then the interest rates in the table will change, and the interest factors will be recalculated as well. To create the data table we need to select A Our PVIF table will serve as a template for each of the other three tables. Be sure to click the Create a Copy box at the bottom of the dialog box. Select the entire table A The PVIF is 0. Time Value of Money Tables in Excel | This tutorial will demonstrate how to create these tables using Excel. For reference, if you change B7 to an annuity due you should get 1. Click the OK button to apply the custom number format. In this case, the table provides a factor that is multiplied by a future value of a lump sum cash flow in order to obtain its fviv value. Future Value Factor Calculator Note that we still need slightly different formulas, depending on the type of annuity as described above. Note that the PV function is only used in the upper-left corner of fcif table. We need to add 1 to the number of columns because we are including column A, which is not a part of the 30 columns specified. Virtually every finance textbook has, at the back, a series of tables that contain multipliers that can tble used to easily calculate present or future values without the need for a financial calculator. Apply a format with a border on the right edge only, and set the font to bold. The key to creating the tables is to understand that they are all based upon the basic time value of money formulas. You can also create a one-input data table by specifying only the row or column input cell, but that wouldn’t suit the purpose here. Formatting isn’t just for making your spreadsheet pretty. For the interest rate we want to allow any decimal number between 0 and 0. Excel does this repeatedly to fill in the table.</td>\n",

       "      <td>. Only in her teens did Natalie begin to rebel, insisting on trying out for a role in the offbeat film “Rebel Without a Cause.” Unlike the cinematic antihero so memorably played by her co-star James Dean, Natalie had good cause to rebel, especially after her mother broke up her first serious romance with a high school sweetheart. (Maria had no such objections when her 16-year-old daughter spent unchaperoned nights with Hollywood VIPs.) Yet, for all the reasons she had to resent her mother, Natalie also recognized how much she owed her. Suzanne Finstad, a lawyer and magazine writer whose previous books include a true-crime story, “Sleeping With the Devil,” and a biography of Priscilla Presley, presents a poignant, intensely sympathetic portrait of the vulnerable, sensitive little girl who grew up to be the quintessential Hollywood star, swathed in sable or mink, never seen in public without her makeup. Yet, as Finstad shows us, there was another side to Natalie: She wanted to become a serious actress, not just a star, and to this end she sought out opportunities to work with directors like Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, actors like James Dean and Scott Marlowe. “On the surface,” writes Finstad, “Natalie’s life seemed like a Sandra Dee movie fantasy of a teenage star ... in her cotton-candy-pink bedroom filled with toy tigers--gifts from male admirers.” Yet a lot of her private time was spent reading books like Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” the kind of books she would have read had she enjoyed the benefits of a college education. Almost everyone who came into contact with Natalie (and Finstad has interviewed hundreds of them--childhood friends, actors, directors, costume designers, hairstylists) seems to have been impressed, not only by her intelligence and professionalism, but by her genuine sweetness. One of the few people who refused to be interviewed was Natalie’s husband, Robert Wagner. Finstad paints quite an insightful portrait of their relationship nonetheless. Only as the story moves toward its tragic conclusion do things grow murky. Natalie’s 1981 death by drowning in the waters off Catalina on a boating excursion with her husband and her co-star Christopher Walken on Thanksgiving weekend still remains something of a mystery. Finstad offers detailed accounts of the testimony of various witnesses--waitresses, a bartender, restaurant patrons, people in a nearby boat, and, most troubling of all, the man who captained the Wagners’ vessel--to what was clearly a strained, unpleasant weekend in which huge quantities of alcohol were consumed. What seems clear from Finstad’s account is that when faced with a genuine emergency Wagner’s first instinct was to be more afraid of negative publicity than of losing his wife. And the flight from truth rippled outwards. In time-hallowed Hollywood fashion, make-believe triumphed over reality.</td>\n",

There are 2 opinions on the matter of Plus Size Fashion and I happen to agree with both! Last night, I caught Trinny and Susannah’s ‘Undress The Nation’ on ITV1, which this week was focused around the fashion options available to plus size women. You have to say plus size really, you can’t get away with fat, obese or unhealthy on TV. Don’t get me wrong, I myself am certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, skinny; in fact, a couple more dress sizes and I’ll be limited to ‘larger lady’ collections too. So, you see, its not like I’m trying to be biased or offensive…the difference is, I’m also not trying to say I’m normal or ‘fabulous’, as one women kept repeating on last nights show. I am overweight and unhealthy and I, granted, most of the time do not look good in current fashions! So what should I do? Should I stick to the dreaded ‘tent tops’ and wide leg trousers, should I wedge myself into a white pair of skinny jeans and deal with my highlighted lumps and bumps in the name of fashion…or maybe I should just lose some weight? No real answer to this question was truly given last night – possibly, because there is no answer or possibly, because ITV was too afraid of offending someone, who knows. Trinny and Susannah have their heart in the right place (I’m a big fan, actually); they tried to get some young designers from the London College of Fashion to create their ‘big girl’ models some fashionable, flattering clothing, but I have to say they failed. All that was really offered were a few square neck pencil dresses in different colours, primarily of the same design. I don’t want to wear that every day either, thanks. The retailers did their bit and joined in on the debate; Elvi and Evans turned up, as expected, along with a small number of representatives from other retailers such as Monsoon, but most were defensive about their collections and decision to stop at a size 16. Even the retailers who offered an 18 and above got criticism; it was suggested that simply making one design in a wide range of sizes wasn’t enough and it should be adapted for the larger ladies unique figure. One representative (from a retailer whose name I’ve forgotten, I think it was Zara) said it would take a whole new design, a whole new template and a completely separate production line to do this…so, a whole separate retail operation then? Like, maybe, Evans (part of Arcadia), for example? I agree here that it really isn’t financially viable for the majority of fashion stores who already make quite enough money serving “size 10 freaks” (the [irresponsible] words of a woman on the show, not mine!) to add bigger sizes, and you have to wonder if getting the retailers to make bigger clothes is really the way forward. I don’t think it is. How about getting people to loose some weight?! I know that there are legitimate reasons for obesity and I know that it’s bloody hard to shed the pounds, but trust me – and this is from one who knows – you’ll feel much better getting into that Topshop size twelve than if you had stayed big and waited for the Topshop ‘Big Is Beautiful’ collection*. You might look alright in plus size clothing, but (and this is purposefully clichéd) you really won’t feel alright on the inside, and that’s what really matters. *not a real collection! As with everything these days it seems the endorsement by a 'celebrity' would encourage the customer to buy into a certain line, so if a popular retailer were to launch a plus size range then the use of someone such as Nigella who is both beautiful and glamourous as well as on the large size to endorse the product, should help sales; equally advice on how to dress the fuller figure would have more credibility if it were delivered by someone larger rather than coming from Trinny and Susannah. Also it is not enough to add plus sizes to the current ranges, but to reshape fabrics into new looks would encourage the customer to feel they were still buying into the trend rather than being forced into Evans or other speciality retailers. It's not rocket science to take an existing garment and modify the look for a larger figure, increase the length, reshape the neck slightly, there's definitely scope for that and using the same fabrics and modifying the styling is a lot less expensive for the retailer than launching a whole new range. From the customer's perspective it might make you feel better to fit into a Top Shop size 12 than than waiting for the plus size range but if you are large and have no chance of shifting the weight then the reality is that being fashionable and having a good body image is going to be about compromise. Posted By Anne | 20 August 2008 13:06 PM Hi Frances. You're right, there is a massive market waiting to be tapped, which I'm sure the retailers will eventually pick up on...it might just take some time! Remember what happened with ecommerce? Only a year ago the number of retailers with websites was unerwhelming, now, ecommerce is making up a large proportion of sales for most of them; the industry does catch up eventually, it just takes a while! Posted By Lorraine | 18 August 2008 09:33 AM Quite frankly I'm surprised the retailers aren't leaping over each other to cater for the plus sizes. We keep being told there's an obesity crisis, so presumably the number of people requiring larger clothes is growing. It's unlike the retailers to deny themselves a great big slice of any market. It makes me wonder what their resaoning would be. What is more powerful than making themselves even more money? It must be the association. They must rather be associated with the \"size 10 freaks\" and fear an association with anyone much larger would actually deny them the skinnier market instead. Presumably there will be a tipping point when the size of the plus size market can no longer be ignored. Posted By Frances | 14 August 2008 18:20</td>\n",

It’s not where I would be allowed to start my boating career, first I had to work in the factory, but it was where I wanted to ultimately end up. I was introduced to all the staff and given and overview of what each person did. The position I was most interested in was Marketing & Sales. So on that day I spent a bit of extra time with our VP of Sales. He showed me a ton of stuff but in particular introduced me to this incredible technology called the BUC system. It was this amazing system that had a list of most of the used yachts that were for sale. You could look up everything and get all kinds of information on boats all around the world. This system was revolutionary and dam expensive. For $15k you got the computer and the rights to access everything and we had one. I couldn’t have been more excited. I could just see it. Clients would come to our office and we would sit down with them and preview all these boats for sale without having to drive to see every single one. Surely this was going to be the future of yacht sales. Except it wasn’t. That same year a little known company launched a website called Yachtworld.com and BUC along with the rest of the industry ignored it. After all BUC was the well respected, originator that had been the “bible” of boat sales since 1961. Combined with the yacht brokers community these new comers will never be a threat to how boats are sold. Until it was. In 2019 you will find nearly 100,000 listings on Yachtworld and over 130,000 listings on Boats.com which bought Yachtworld in 2000. No other boat listing system comes close to the collective power of these services and brands. They have won the end user when it comes to finding boats for sale via search and that is a very dangerous position to be in if you are in sales. Don’t believe me? Just watch whats happened to Realestate and you can get a preview of where we are headed. Everyone knows Zillow today but when they started in 2009 no one, especially Realtors, could have predicted where the industry would be at in less than 10 years. Today Zillow has won the end user. Today agents are at the mercy of Zillow to produce leads. Today after a decade of giving Zillow all the information agents must look back and think, “what the hell just happened?” It’s going to happen to us. As of today Yachtworld has not implemented a pay per lead program such as Zillows. However tomorrow they will. The purchase of Yachtcloser last year is a subtle step in that direction. Yachtworld is building a database that knows every buyer, every seller, the exact selling price, I mean EXACT, and a list of other valuable, detailed, accurate information. So imagine you were the leading brand with consumers searching to buy a boat and could now offer them information such as previous sale price, previous days on market, noted deficiencies on any conditional acceptances, and the list goes on. If you don’t think they will you are kidding yourself. Zillow always promised the agents that Zillow just a marketing company and they would never compete against agents for commissions. Until Opendoor and iBuyer programs came along. Now Zillow buys houses with their ZillowOffers program. Today Zillow utilizes an agent when completing a ZillowOffers transaction. One that is part of their preferred paying agent network therefore insuring agents still get a commission. However how long can that last when Opendoor is a brokerage house and cuts listing fees by 50%. How long until Zillow becomes a brokerage and buys and sells without any agents involvement? It’s coming sooner than you think. Stop being so negative. The good news is that our industry is much slower moving with far far fewer transactions. So perhaps Yachtworld won’t buy and sell yachts someday thus cutting out salesmen. Perhaps they wont even do a pay per lead program. Maybe all that transactional data that they are collecting will simply sit on servers never to be aggregated and disseminated. However I’m not betting my next 20 years in this industry on presuming any of that. So what should we do? Focus on the consumers needs and build your personal brand. The one advantage you have over any company, service or brokerage house is your ability to create relationships with clients. Your ability to be a person and not just a brand gives you a huge advantage in the coming decades. Today’s tools available to you from companies such as Linked In, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. give you a leg up insuring your don’t become the next BUC of the industry. The biggest mistake you could make is to blow these tools off as silly social sites that people go on to talk about their pets, bitch about their problems, promote themselves and give political opinions. Yeah sure this is going on, but make no mistake about it, these platforms work to gain trust, sell yourself and get clients. After 23 years of doing this there is one thing I know. Nothing stays the same forever. Which means we shouldn’t either. There is a storm coming now is the time to prepare.\n",

I've had school exams, university interviews and lots more, meaning that my blog had to take a back seat for a while. I'm planning some new exciting posts so hopefully they'll also be up soon! But for now I really wanted to share some of my favourite outfits from the past month or so! I love posting photos on my Twitter so I thought it would be a good idea to collect them all together. Denim pinafore dress- Primark Striped top- Primark Tights- Primark Shoes- Converse All Stars Glasses- Specsavers This is my newest outfit and I think its perfect for the transition from Winter to Spring! Its super comfy yet looks really cute. I'm OBSESSED with stripes at the moment so I'm grabbing every striped top, dress and skirt I can see..! Jumpsuit- New Look Heeled shoes- New Look This is by far my favourite 'going- out' outfit at the moment. Its so simple but looks really special and it makes me feel great when I'm wearing it because its so flattering. I wore it when I went to see Les Mis on the West End (the best night ever... blog post to follow) Polar- neck top- H&M Skirt- ZARA Tights- Primark Shoes- M&S Watch- NEXT This is by far my favourite outfit of the past season!

Such an easy costume but very effective, I think! Skirt- Primark Polar-neck jumper- M&S Tights- Primark Boots- Topshop Watch- NEXT This is what I wore on Boxing Day to watch the Pantomime at the theatre!

You can also use the future value factor table to find the value of future value factor. Pvif & Fvif Table – Free download as Word Doc .doc /.docx), PDF File .pdf), Text File .txt) or read online for free. Financial Table,Pvif Table,Fvif table. Future Value Interest Factor: FVIF(i, n). Financial Problems and Analysis . Appendix B. Future Value Interest Factor: FVIF(i, n). To set up the rules, select a cell or range and then click the Conditional Formatting button on the Home tab of the ribbon. Additionally, fvof need to specify the Type argument to the function. This will launch the following dialog box:. You can see how the rules are created. Also, we don’t need to see the number in A For the second rule we want to apply a border to the right edge of column A, but only those rows that are supposed to be visible in the table. The third rule will hide everything outside of the visible part of the table as defined by the values in B5: In the Type edit box, enter “Period” include the fivf marks. Substituting 1 for FV, fif for N, and 0. Future Value of $1 Table If you change to an annuity due in B7 then, for reference, you should get 1. Then you have to interpolate because 3. But what happens if the interest rate is 3. For example, we don’t want them to enter a negative interest rate in B1. Let’s take care of a couple of simple items first. Click B7 and then the Data Validation button. They must be formulas that will evaluate to either True or False. Go to the Number tab and choose the Custom category. If you change the value in B1, for example, then the interest rates in the table will change, and the interest factors will be recalculated as well. To create the data table we need to select A Our PVIF table will serve as a template for each of the other three tables. Be sure to click the Create a Copy box at the bottom of the dialog box. Select the entire table A The PVIF is 0. Time Value of Money Tables in Excel | This tutorial will demonstrate how to create these tables using Excel. For reference, if you change B7 to an annuity due you should get 1. Click the OK button to apply the custom number format. In this case, the table provides a factor that is multiplied by a future value of a lump sum cash flow in order to obtain its fviv value. Future Value Factor Calculator Note that we still need slightly different formulas, depending on the type of annuity as described above. Note that the PV function is only used in the upper-left corner of fcif table. We need to add 1 to the number of columns because we are including column A, which is not a part of the 30 columns specified. Virtually every finance textbook has, at the back, a series of tables that contain multipliers that can tble used to easily calculate present or future values without the need for a financial calculator. Apply a format with a border on the right edge only, and set the font to bold. The key to creating the tables is to understand that they are all based upon the basic time value of money formulas. You can also create a one-input data table by specifying only the row or column input cell, but that wouldn’t suit the purpose here. Formatting isn’t just for making your spreadsheet pretty. For the interest rate we want to allow any decimal number between 0 and 0. Excel does this repeatedly to fill in the table.\n",

Only in her teens did Natalie begin to rebel, insisting on trying out for a role in the offbeat film “Rebel Without a Cause.” Unlike the cinematic antihero so memorably played by her co-star James Dean, Natalie had good cause to rebel, especially after her mother broke up her first serious romance with a high school sweetheart. (Maria had no such objections when her 16-year-old daughter spent unchaperoned nights with Hollywood VIPs.) Yet, for all the reasons she had to resent her mother, Natalie also recognized how much she owed her. Suzanne Finstad, a lawyer and magazine writer whose previous books include a true-crime story, “Sleeping With the Devil,” and a biography of Priscilla Presley, presents a poignant, intensely sympathetic portrait of the vulnerable, sensitive little girl who grew up to be the quintessential Hollywood star, swathed in sable or mink, never seen in public without her makeup. Yet, as Finstad shows us, there was another side to Natalie: She wanted to become a serious actress, not just a star, and to this end she sought out opportunities to work with directors like Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, actors like James Dean and Scott Marlowe. “On the surface,” writes Finstad, “Natalie’s life seemed like a Sandra Dee movie fantasy of a teenage star ... in her cotton-candy-pink bedroom filled with toy tigers--gifts from male admirers.” Yet a lot of her private time was spent reading books like Nietzsche’s “Thus Spake Zarathustra,” the kind of books she would have read had she enjoyed the benefits of a college education. Almost everyone who came into contact with Natalie (and Finstad has interviewed hundreds of them--childhood friends, actors, directors, costume designers, hairstylists) seems to have been impressed, not only by her intelligence and professionalism, but by her genuine sweetness. One of the few people who refused to be interviewed was Natalie’s husband, Robert Wagner. Finstad paints quite an insightful portrait of their relationship nonetheless. Only as the story moves toward its tragic conclusion do things grow murky. Natalie’s 1981 death by drowning in the waters off Catalina on a boating excursion with her husband and her co-star Christopher Walken on Thanksgiving weekend still remains something of a mystery. Finstad offers detailed accounts of the testimony of various witnesses--waitresses, a bartender, restaurant patrons, people in a nearby boat, and, most troubling of all, the man who captained the Wagners’ vessel--to what was clearly a strained, unpleasant weekend in which huge quantities of alcohol were consumed. What seems clear from Finstad’s account is that when faced with a genuine emergency Wagner’s first instinct was to be more afraid of negative publicity than of losing his wife. And the flight from truth rippled outwards. In time-hallowed Hollywood fashion, make-believe triumphed over reality.\n",
       "9  MEMBER'S LOGIN You are here: Home | Blog | Trinny and Susannah Undress the Obesity Crisis Trinny and Susannah Undress the Obesity Crisis Posted At: 13 August 2008 11:15 AMRelated Categories: General, Retailers This blog is going to be a bit controversial and a bit undecided, I warn you now. There are 2 opinions on the matter of Plus Size Fashion and I happen to agree with both! Last night, I caught Trinny and Susannah’s ‘Undress The Nation’ on ITV1, which this week was focused around the fashion options available to plus size women. You have to say plus size really, you can’t get away with fat, obese or unhealthy on TV. Don’t get me wrong, I myself am certainly not, by any stretch of the imagination, skinny; in fact, a couple more dress sizes and I’ll be limited to ‘larger lady’ collections too. So, you see, its not like I’m trying to be biased or offensive…the difference is, I’m also not trying to say I’m normal or ‘fabulous’, as one women kept repeating on last nights show. I am overweight and unhealthy and I, granted, most of the time do not look good in current fashions! So what should I do? Should I stick to the dreaded ‘tent tops’ and wide leg trousers, should I wedge myself into a white pair of skinny jeans and deal with my highlighted lumps and bumps in the name of fashion…or maybe I should just lose some weight? No real answer to this question was truly given last night – possibly, because there is no answer or possibly, because ITV was too afraid of offending someone, who knows. Trinny and Susannah have their heart in the right place (I’m a big fan, actually); they tried to get some young designers from the London College of Fashion to create their ‘big girl’ models some fashionable, flattering clothing, but I have to say they failed. All that was really offered were a few square neck pencil dresses in different colours, primarily of the same design. I don’t want to wear that every day either, thanks. The retailers did their bit and joined in on the debate; Elvi and Evans turned up, as expected, along with a small number of representatives from other retailers such as Monsoon, but most were defensive about their collections and decision to stop at a size 16. Even the retailers who offered an 18 and above got criticism; it was suggested that simply making one design in a wide range of sizes wasn’t enough and it should be adapted for the larger ladies unique figure. One representative (from a retailer whose name I’ve forgotten, I think it was Zara) said it would take a whole new design, a whole new template and a completely separate production line to do this…so, a whole separate retail operation then? Like, maybe, Evans (part of Arcadia), for example? I agree here that it really isn’t financially viable for the majority of fashion stores who already make quite enough money serving “size 10 freaks” (the [irresponsible] words of a woman on the show, not mine!) to add bigger sizes, and you have to wonder if getting the retailers to make bigger clothes is really the way forward. I don’t think it is. How about getting people to loose some weight?! I know that there are legitimate reasons for obesity and I know that it’s bloody hard to shed the pounds, but trust me – and this is from one who knows – you’ll feel much better getting into that Topshop size twelve than if you had stayed big and waited for the Topshop ‘Big Is Beautiful’ collection*. You might look alright in plus size clothing, but (and this is purposefully clichéd) you really won’t feel alright on the inside, and that’s what really matters. *not a real collection! As with everything these days it seems the endorsement by a 'celebrity' would encourage the customer to buy into a certain line, so if a popular retailer were to launch a plus size range then the use of someone such as Nigella who is both beautiful and glamourous as well as on the large size to endorse the product, should help sales; equally advice on how to dress the fuller figure would have more credibility if it were delivered by someone larger rather than coming from Trinny and Susannah. Also it is not enough to add plus sizes to the current ranges, but to reshape fabrics into new looks would encourage the customer to feel they were still buying into the trend rather than being forced into Evans or other speciality retailers. It's not rocket science to take an existing garment and modify the look for a larger figure, increase the length, reshape the neck slightly, there's definitely scope for that and using the same fabrics and modifying the styling is a lot less expensive for the retailer than launching a whole new range. From the customer's perspective it might make you feel better to fit into a Top Shop size 12 than than waiting for the plus size range but if you are large and have no chance of shifting the weight then the reality is that being fashionable and having a good body image is going to be about compromise. Posted By Anne | 20 August 2008 13:06 PM Hi Frances. You're right, there is a massive market waiting to be tapped, which I'm sure the retailers will eventually pick up on...it might just take some time! Remember what happened with ecommerce? Only a year ago the number of retailers with websites was unerwhelming, now, ecommerce is making up a large proportion of sales for most of them; the industry does catch up eventually, it just takes a while! Posted By Lorraine | 18 August 2008 09:33 AM Quite frankly I'm surprised the retailers aren't leaping over each other to cater for the plus sizes. We keep being told there's an obesity crisis, so presumably the number of people requiring larger clothes is growing. It's unlike the retailers to deny themselves a great big slice of any market. It makes me wonder what their resaoning would be. What is more powerful than making themselves even more money? It must be the association. They must rather be associated with the \"size 10 freaks\" and fear an association with anyone much larger would actually deny them the skinnier market instead. Presumably there will be a tipping point when the size of the plus size market can no longer be ignored. Posted By Frances | 14 August 2008 18:20"

       "      <td>Mexico's Slim top Gates in billionaires index A new ranking of the world’s billionaires puts Mexican telco mogul Carlos Slim ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The Bloomberg news service's just-launched daily Billionaires Index calculates the changing market worth of 20 wealthiest individuals. Mr Slim’s net worth fell $US478.4 million in a day to $US68.5 billion as of the close of markets on March 2, when the index was first calculated, but his fortune has increased 11% this year. Mr Gates is worth $US62.4 billion, down $US102.1 million on March 2 and up 11% year to date. Investor and co-philanthropist Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, declined $US336.9 million to $US43.8 billion on March 2 and is up 2.4% in 2012. The combined net worth of the 20 richest people is $US676.8 billion. Nine are Americans, including three from the family of Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores. Three Europeans are ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. Sweden’s Ingvar Kamprad, who is worth $US42.5 billion, controls Ikea Group. Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), has a $US42.3 billion based on his shareholding, while Spaniard Amancio Ortega owns the Zara clothing chain and is worth $US38.8 billion. Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s $US38 billion fortune puts him seventh and $US4 billion ahead of brothers Charles and David Koch, who each own 42% of Koch Industries, a refining and chemical maker. The fastest climber on the list is Brazil’s Eike Batista, who ranks 10th at $US29.8 billion, up $US133.9 million on March 2. His fortune based on investments in iron ore and coal, has grown 32% this year. The top billionaire in the Australasian region is Gina Rinehart, the Australian mining heiress who is worth $US20.4 billion, $US2 billion short of the 20th person on the list, Liliane Bettencourt, heiress to the French Oréal empire.</td>\n",

      "|Mexico's Slim top Gates in billionaires index A new ranking of the world’s billionaires puts Mexican telco mogul Carlos Slim ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates. The Bloomberg news service's just-launched daily Billionaires Index calculates the changing market worth of 20 wealthiest individuals. Mr Slim’s net worth fell $US478.4 million in a day to $US68.5 billion as of the close of markets on March 2, when the index was first calculated, but his fortune has increased 11% this year. Mr Gates is worth $US62.4 billion, down $US102.1 million on March 2 and up 11% year to date. Investor and co-philanthropist Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, declined $US336.9 million to $US43.8 billion on March 2 and is up 2.4% in 2012. The combined net worth of the 20 richest people is $US676.8 billion. Nine are Americans, including three from the family of Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart Stores. Three Europeans are ranked fourth, fifth and sixth. Sweden’s Ingvar Kamprad, who is worth $US42.5 billion, controls Ikea Group. Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), has a $US42.3 billion based on his shareholding, while Spaniard Amancio Ortega owns the Zara clothing chain and is worth $US38.8 billion. Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s $US38 billion fortune puts him seventh and $US4 billion ahead of brothers Charles and David Koch, who each own 42% of Koch Industries, a refining and chemical maker. The fastest climber on the list is Brazil’s Eike Batista, who ranks 10th at $US29.8 billion, up $US133.9 million on March 2. His fortune based on investments in iron ore and coal, has grown 32% this year. The top billionaire in the Australasian region is Gina Rinehart, the Australian mining heiress who is worth $US20.4 billion, $US2 billion short of the 20th person on the list, Liliane Bettencourt, heiress to the French Oréal empire.|\n",

A Kalman Filter Based Technique for Stator Turn-Fault Detection of the Induction Motors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ghanbari, Teymoor; Samet, Haidar 2017-11-01 Monitoring of the Induction Motors (IMs) through stator current for different faults diagnosis has considerable economic and technical advantages in comparison with the other techniques in this content. Among different faults of an IM, stator and bearing faults are more probable types, which can be detected by analyzing signatures of the stator currents. One of the most reliable indicators for fault detection of IMs is lower sidebands of power frequency in the stator currents. This paper deals with a novel simple technique for detecting stator turn-fault of the IMs. Frequencies of the lower sidebands are determined using the motor specifications and their amplitudes are estimated by a Kalman Filter (KF). Instantaneous Total Harmonic Distortion (ITHD) of these harmonics is calculated. Since variation of the ITHD for the three-phase currents is considerable in case of stator turn-fault, the fault can be detected using this criterion, confidently. Different simulation results verify high performance of the proposed method. The performance of the method is also confirmed using some experiments. Detection of broken rotor bar faults in induction motor at low load using neural network. Bessam, B; Menacer, A; Boumehraz, M; Cherif, H 2016-09-01 The knowledge of the broken rotor bars characteristic frequencies and amplitudes has a great importance for all related diagnostic methods. The monitoring of motor faults requires a high resolution spectrum to separate different frequency components. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) has been widely used to achieve these requirements. However, at low slip this technique cannot give good results. As a solution for these problems, this paper proposes an efficient technique based on a neural network approach and Hilbert transform (HT) for broken rotor bar diagnosis in induction machines at low load. The Hilbert transform is used to extract the stator current envelope (SCE). Two features are selected from the (SCE) spectrum (the amplitude and frequency of the harmonic). These features will be used as input for neural network. The results obtained are astonishing and it is capable to detect the correct number of broken rotor bars under different load conditions.

Mechanical fault detection of electric motors by laser vibrometer and accelerometer measurements NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cristalli, C.; Paone, N.; Rodríguez, R. M. 2006-08-01 This paper presents a comparative study between accelerometer and laser vibrometer measurements aimed at on-line quality control carried out on the universal motors used in washing machines, which exhibit defects localised mainly in the bearings, including faults in the cage, in the rolling element and in the outer and inner ring. A set of no defective and defective motors were analysed by means of the acceleration signal provided by the accelerometer, and the displacement and velocity signals given by a single-point laser vibrometer. Advantages and disadvantages of both absolute and relative sensors and of contact and non-contact instrumentation are discussed taking into account the applicability to real on-line quality control measurements and bringing to light the related measurement problems due to the specific environmental conditions of assembly lines and sensor installation constraints. The performance of different signal-processing algorithms is discussed: RMS computation at steady-state proves effective for pass or fail diagnosis, while the amplitude of selected frequencies in the averaged spectra allows also for classification of a variety of special faults in bearings. Joint time-frequency analysis output data can be successfully used for pass or fail diagnosis during transients, thus achieving a remarkable reduction in testing time, which is important for on-line diagnostics. Induction motor broken rotor bar fault location detection through envelope analysis of start-up current using Hilbert transform NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Abd-el-Malek, Mina; Abdelsalam, Ahmed K.; Hassan, Ola E. 2017-09-01 Robustness, low running cost and reduced maintenance lead Induction Motors (IMs) to pioneerly penetrate the industrial drive system fields. Broken rotor bars (BRBs) can be considered as an important fault that needs to be early assessed to minimize the maintenance cost and labor time. The majority of recent BRBs' fault diagnostic techniques focus on differentiating between healthy and faulty rotor cage. In this paper, a new technique is proposed for detecting the location of the broken bar in the rotor. The proposed technique relies on monitoring certain statistical parameters estimated from the analysis of the start-up stator current envelope. The envelope of the signal is obtained using Hilbert Transformation (HT). The proposed technique offers non-invasive, fast computational and accurate location diagnostic process. Various simulation scenarios are presented that validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. A simple approach to detect and correct signal faults of Hall position sensors for brushless DC motors at steady speed NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Shi, Yongli; Wu, Zhong; Zhi, Kangyi; Xiong, Jun 2018-03-01 In order to realize reliable commutation of brushless DC motors (BLDCMs), a simple approach is proposed to detect and correct signal faults of Hall position sensors in this paper. First, the time instant of the next jumping edge for Hall signals is predicted by using prior information of pulse intervals in the last electrical period. Considering the possible errors between the predicted instant and the real one, a confidence interval is set by using the predicted value and a suitable tolerance for the next pulse edge. According to the relationship between the real pulse edge and the confidence interval, Hall signals can be judged and the signal faults can be corrected. Experimental results of a BLDCM at steady speed demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. A review and comparison of fault detection and diagnosis methods for squirrel-cage induction motors: State of the art. Liu, Yiqi; Bazzi, Ali M 2017-09-01 Preventing induction motors (IMs) from failure and shutdown is important to maintain functionality of many critical loads in industry and commerce. This paper provides a comprehensive review of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods targeting all the four major types of faults in IMs. Popular FDD methods published up to 2010 are briefly introduced, while the focus of the review is laid on the state-of-the-art FDD techniques after 2010, i.e. in 2011-2015 and some in 2016. Different FDD methods are introduced and classified into four categories depending on their application domains, instead of on fault types like in many other reviews, to better reveal hidden connections and similarities of different FDD methods. Detailed comparisons of the reviewed papers after 2010 are given in tables for fast referring. Finally, a dedicated discussion session is provided, which presents recent developments, trends and remaining difficulties regarding to FDD of IMs, to inspire novel research ideas and new research possibilities.

Online Detection of Broken Rotor Bar Fault in Induction Motors by Combining Estimation of Signal Parameters via Min-norm Algorithm and Least Square Method NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Pan-Pan; Yu, Qiang; Hu, Yong-Jun; Miao, Chang-Xin 2017-11-01 Current research in broken rotor bar (BRB) fault detection in induction motors is primarily focused on a high-frequency resolution analysis of the stator current. Compared with a discrete Fourier transformation, the parametric spectrum estimation technique has a higher frequency accuracy and resolution. However, the existing detection methods based on parametric spectrum estimation cannot realize online detection, owing to the large computational cost. To improve the efficiency of BRB fault detection, a new detection method based on the min-norm algorithm and least square estimation is proposed in this paper. First, the stator current is filtered using a band-pass filter and divided into short overlapped data windows. The min-norm algorithm is then applied to determine the frequencies of the fundamental and fault characteristic components with each overlapped data window. Next, based on the frequency values obtained, a model of the fault current signal is constructed. Subsequently, a linear least squares problem solved through singular value decomposition is designed to estimate the amplitudes and phases of the related components. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a simulated current and an actual motor, the results of which indicate that, not only parametric spectrum estimation technique.more ».« less Randomness fault detection system NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Russell, B. Don (Inventor); Aucoin, B. Michael (Inventor); Benner, Carl L. (Inventor) 1996-01-01 A method and apparatus are provided for detecting a fault on a power line carrying a line parameter such as a load current. The apparatus monitors and analyzes the load current to obtain an energy value. The energy value is compared to a threshold value stored in a buffer. If the energy value is greater than the threshold value a counter is incremented. If the energy value is greater than a high value threshold or less than a low value threshold then a second counter is incremented. If the difference between two subsequent energy values is greater than a constant then a third counter is incremented. A fault signal is issued if the counter is greater than a counter limit value and either the second counter is greater than a second limit value or the third counter is greater than a third limit value. Cage-rotor induction motor inter-turn short circuit fault detection with and without saturation effect by MEC model. Naderi, Peyman 2016-09-01 The inter-turn short fault for the Cage-Rotor-Induction-Machine (CRIM) is studied in this paper and its local saturation is taken into account. However, in order to observe the exact behavior of machine, the Magnetic-Equivalent-Circuit (MEC) and nonlinear B-H curve are proposed to provide an insight into the machine model and saturation effect respectively. The electrical machines are generally operated near to their saturation zone due to some design necessities. Hence, when the machine is exposed to a fault such as short circuit or eccentricities, it is operated within its saturation zone and thus, time and space harmonics are integrated and as a result, current and torque harmonics are generated which the phenomenon cannot be explored when saturation is dismissed. Nonetheless, inter-turn short circuit may lead to local saturation and this occurrence is studied in this paper using MEC model. In order to achieve the mentioned objectives, two and also four-pole machines are modeled as two samples and the machines performances are analyzed in healthy and faulty cases with and without saturation effect. A novel strategy is proposed to precisely detect inter-turn short circuit fault according to the stator׳s lines current signatures and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.

An Intelligent Harmonic Synthesis Technique for Air-Gap Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Li, De Z.; Wang, Wilson; Ismail, Fathy 2017-11-01 Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in various industrial applications. To improve energy consumption efficiency, a reliable IM health condition monitoring system is very useful to detect IM fault at its earliest stage to prevent operation degradation, and malfunction of IMs. An intelligent harmonic synthesis technique is proposed in this work to conduct incipient air-gap eccentricity fault detection in IMs. The fault harmonic series are synthesized to enhance fault features. Fault related local spectra are processed to derive fault indicators for IM air-gap eccentricity diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed harmonic synthesis technique is examined experimentally by IMs with static air-gap eccentricity and dynamic air-gap eccentricity states under different load conditions. Test results show that the developed harmonic synthesis technique can extract fault features effectively for initial IM air-gap eccentricity fault detection. Discrete wavelet transform and energy eigen value for rotor bars fault detection in variable speed field-oriented control of induction motor drive. Ameid, Tarek; Menacer, Arezki; Talhaoui, Hicham; Azzoug, Youness 2018-05-03 This paper presents a methodology for the broken rotor bars fault detection is considered when the rotor speed varies continuously and the induction machine is controlled by Field-Oriented Control (FOC). The rotor fault detection is obtained by analyzing a several mechanical and electrical quantities (i.e., rotor speed, stator phase current and output signal of the speed regulator) by the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in variable speed drives. The severity of the fault is obtained by stored energy calculation for active power signal. Hence, it can be a useful solution as fault indicator. The FOC is implemented in order to preserve a good performance speed control; to compensate the broken rotor bars effect in the mechanical speed and to ensure the operation continuity and to investigate the fault effect in the variable speed. The effectiveness of the technique is evaluated in simulation and in a real-time implementation by using Matlab/Simulink with the real-time interface (RTI) based on dSpace 1104 board.

Fault detection and isolation for complex system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jing, Chan Shi; Bayuaji, Luhur; Samad, R.; Mustafa, M.; Abdullah, N. R. H.; Zain, Z. M.; Pebrianti, Dwi 2017-07-01 Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) is a method to monitor, identify, and pinpoint the type and location of system fault in a complex multiple input multiple output (MIMO) non-linear system. A two wheel robot is used as a complex system in this study. The aim of the research is to construct and design a Fault Detection and Isolation algorithm. The proposed method for the fault identification is using hybrid technique that combines Kalman filter and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The Kalman filter is able to recognize the data from the sensors of the system and indicate the fault of the system in the sensor reading. Error prediction is based on the fault magnitude and the time occurrence of fault. Additionally, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is another algorithm used to determine the type of fault and isolate the fault in the system. Various Indices for Diagnosis of Air-gap Eccentricity Fault in Induction Motor-A Review NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Nikhil; Mathew, Lini, Dr.; Sharma, Amandeep 2018-03-01 From the past few years, research has gained an ardent pace in the field of fault detection and diagnosis in induction motors. In the current scenario, software is being introduced with diagnostic features to improve stability and reliability in fault diagnostic techniques. Human involvement in decision making for fault detection is slowly being replaced by Artificial Intelligence techniques. In this paper, a brief introduction of eccentricity fault is presented along with their causes and effects on the health of induction motors. Various indices used to detect eccentricity are being introduced along with their boundary conditions and their future scope of research. At last, merits and demerits of all indices are discussed and a comparison is made between them.. Integral Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation for Railway Traction Drive.

Infrared thermography based diagnosis of inter-turn fault and cooling system failure in three phase induction motor NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Singh, Gurmeet; Naikan, V. N. A. 2017-12-01 Thermography has been widely used as a technique for anomaly detection in induction motors. International Electrical Testing Association (NETA) proposed guidelines for thermographic inspection of electrical systems and rotating equipment. These guidelines help in anomaly detection and estimating its severity. However, it focus only on location of hotspot rather than diagnosing the fault. This paper addresses two such faults i.e. inter-turn fault and failure of cooling system, where both results in increase of stator temperature. Present paper proposes two thermal profile indicators using thermal analysis of IRT images. These indicators are in compliance with NETA standard. These indicators help in correctly diagnosing inter-turn fault and failure of cooling system. The work has been experimentally validated for healthy and with seeded faults scenarios of induction motors.

However, it remains poorly understood whether RSCM are useful for detecting past frictional heating on faults. To detect increased heating during seismic slip, we examine the thrust fault in the Jurassic accretionary complex, central Japan. The thrust fault zone includes 10 cm-thick cataclasite and a few mm-thick dark layer. The cataclasite is characterized by fragments of black and gray chert in the black carbonaceous mudstone matrix. The dark layer is marked by intensely cracked gray chert fragments in the dark matrix of carbonaceous mudstone composition, which bounds the fractured gray chert above from the cataclasite below. The RSCM are analyzed for carbonaceous material in the cataclasite, dark layer, and host rock &lt;10 mm from cataclasite and dark layer boundaries. The result indicates that there is no increased carbonization in the cataclasite. In contrast, the dark layer and part of host rocks &lt;2 mm from the dark layer boundaries show prominent increase in carbonization. The absent of increased carbonization in the cataclasite could be attributed to insufficient frictional heating associated with distributed shear and/or faulting at low slip rates. The dark layer exhibits the appearance of fault and injection veins, and the dark layer boundaries are irregularly embayed or intensely cracked; these features have been characteristically observed in pseudotachylytes. Therefore, the increased carbonization in the dark layer is likely resulted from increased heating during earthquake faulting. The intensely cracked fragments in the dark layer and cracked wall rocks may reflect thermal fracturing in chert, which is caused by heat conduction from the molten zone. We suggest that RSCM are useful for the detection of increased heating on faults, particularly when the temperature is high enough for frictional melting and thermal fracturing.. PMID:22163789. Latent component-based gear tooth fault detection filter using advanced parametric modeling NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ettefagh, M. M.; Sadeghi, M. H.; Rezaee, M.; Chitsaz, S. 2009-10-01 In this paper, a new parametric model-based filter is proposed for gear tooth fault detection. The designing of the filter consists of identifying the most proper latent component (LC) of the undamaged gearbox signal by analyzing the instant modules (IMs) and instant frequencies (IFs) and then using the component with lowest IM as the proposed filter output for detecting fault of the gearbox. The filter parameters are estimated by using the LC theory in which an advanced parametric modeling method has been implemented. The proposed method is applied on the signals, extracted from simulated gearbox for detection of the simulated gear faults. In addition, the method is used for quality inspection of the produced Nissan-Junior vehicle gearbox by gear profile error detection in an industrial test bed. For evaluation purpose, the proposed method is compared with the previous parametric TAR/AR-based filters in which the parametric model residual is considered as the filter output and also Yule-Walker and Kalman filter are implemented for estimating the parameters. The results confirm the high performance of the new proposed fault detection method.. Wind turbine fault detection and classification by means of image texture analysis NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ruiz, Magda; Mujica, Luis E.; Alférez, Santiago; Acho, Leonardo; Tutivén, Christian; Vidal, Yolanda; Rodellar, José; Pozo, Francesc 2018-07-01 The future of the wind energy industry passes through the use of larger and more flexible wind turbines in remote locations, which are increasingly offshore to benefit stronger and more uniform wind conditions. The cost of operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines is approximately 15-35% of the total cost. Of this, 80% goes towards unplanned maintenance issues due to different faults in the wind turbine components. Thus, an auspicious way to contribute to the increasing demands and challenges is by applying low-cost advanced fault detection schemes. This work proposes a new method for detection and classification of wind turbine actuators and sensors faults in variable-speed wind turbines. For this purpose, time domain signals acquired from the operating wind turbine are represented as two-dimensional matrices to obtain grayscale digital images. Then, the image pattern recognition is processed getting texture features under a multichannel representation. In this work, four types of texture characteristics are used: statistical, wavelet, granulometric and Gabor features. Next, the most significant ones are selected using the conditional mutual criterion. Finally, the faults are detected and distinguished between them (classified) using an automatic classification tool. In particular, a 10-fold cross-validation is used to obtain a more generalized model and evaluates the classification performance. Coupled non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations of a 5 MW offshore type wind turbine are carried out in several fault scenarios. The results show a promising methodology able to detect and classify the most common wind turbine faults.. Rule-based fault diagnosis of hall sensors and fault-tolerant control of PMSM NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Song, Ziyou; Li, Jianqiu; Ouyang, Minggao; Gu, Jing; Feng, Xuning; Lu, Dongbin 2013-07-01 Hall sensor is widely used for estimating rotor phase of permanent magnet synchronous motor(PMSM). And rotor position is an essential parameter of PMSM control algorithm, hence it is very dangerous if Hall senor faults occur. But there is scarcely any research focusing on fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of Hall sensor used in PMSM. From this standpoint, the Hall sensor faults which may occur during the PMSM operating are theoretically analyzed. According to the analysis results, the fault diagnosis algorithm of Hall sensor, which is based on three rules, is proposed to classify the fault phenomena accurately. The rotor phase estimation algorithms, based on one or two Hall sensor(s), are initialized to engender the fault-tolerant control algorithm. The fault diagnosis algorithm can detect 60 Hall fault phenomena in total as well as all detections can be fulfilled in 1/138 rotor rotation period. The fault-tolerant control algorithm can achieve a smooth torque production which means the same control effect as normal control mode (with three Hall sensors). Finally, the PMSM bench test verifies the accuracy and rapidity of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control strategies. The fault diagnosis algorithm can detect all Hall sensor faults promptly and fault-tolerant control algorithm allows the PMSM to face failure conditions of one or two Hall sensor(s). In addition, the transitions between health-control and fault-tolerant control conditions are smooth without any additional noise and harshness. Proposed algorithms can deal with the Hall sensor faults of PMSM in real applications, and can be provided to realize the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of PMSM.

The CPRBF network consists of a number of radial basis function (RBF) subnets connected in parallel. The number of input nodes for each RBF subnet is determined by different embedding dimension based on chaotic phase-space reconstruction. The output of CPRBF is a weighted sum of all RBF subnets. It was first trained using the dataset from normal state without fault, and then a residual error generator was designed to detect failures based on the trained CPRBF network. Then, failure detection can be achieved by the analysis of the residual error. Finally, two case studies are introduced to compare the proposed CPRBF network with traditional RBF networks, in terms of prediction and detection accuracy.. An adaptive confidence limit for periodic non-steady conditions fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Tianzhen; Wu, Hao; Ni, Mengqi; Zhang, Milu; Dong, Jingjing; Benbouzid, Mohamed El Hachemi; Hu, Xiong 2016-05-01 System monitoring has become a major concern in batch process due to the fact that failure rate in non-steady conditions is much higher than in steady ones. A series of approaches based on PCA have already solved problems such as data dimensionality reduction, multivariable decorrelation, and processing non-changing signal. However, if the data follows non-Gaussian distribution or the variables contain some signal changes, the above approaches are not applicable. To deal with these concerns and to enhance performance in multiperiod data processing, this paper proposes a fault detection method using adaptive confidence limit (ACL) in periodic non-steady conditions. The proposed ACL method achieves four main enhancements: Longitudinal-Standardization could convert non-Gaussian sampling data to Gaussian ones; the multiperiod PCA algorithm could reduce dimensionality, remove correlation, and improve the monitoring accuracy; the adaptive confidence limit could detect faults under non-steady conditions; the fault sections determination procedure could select the appropriate parameter of the adaptive confidence limit. The achieved result analysis clearly shows that the proposed ACL method is superior to other fault detection approaches under periodic non-steady conditions..

Failure detection and fault management techniques for flush airdata sensing systems NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Whitmore, Stephen A.; Moes, Timothy R.; Leondes, Cornelius T. 1992-01-01 Methods based on chi-squared analysis are presented for detecting system and individual-port failures in the high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system on the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle. The HI-FADS hardware is introduced, and the aerodynamic model describes measured pressure in terms of dynamic pressure, angle of attack, angle of sideslip, and static pressure. Chi-squared analysis is described in the presentation of the concept for failure detection and fault management which includes nominal, iteration, and fault-management modes. A matrix of pressure orifices arranged in concentric circles on the nose of the aircraft indicate the parameters which are applied to the regression algorithms. The sensing techniques are applied to the F-18 flight data, and two examples are given of the computed angle-of-attack time histories. The failure-detection and fault-management techniques permit the matrix to be multiply redundant, and the chi-squared analysis is shown to be useful in the detection of failures.

Set-membership fault detection under noisy environment with application to the detection of abnormal aircraft control surface positions NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) El Houda Thabet, Rihab; Combastel, Christophe; Raïssi, Tarek; Zolghadri, Ali 2015-09-01 The paper develops a set membership detection methodology which is applied to the detection of abnormal positions of aircraft control surfaces. Robust and early detection of such abnormal positions is an important issue for early system reconfiguration and overall optimisation of aircraft design. In order to improve fault sensitivity while ensuring a high level of robustness, the method combines a data-driven characterisation of noise and a model-driven approach based on interval prediction. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation results obtained based on data recorded in several flight scenarios of a highly representative aircraft benchmark..

An imbalance fault detection method based on data normalization and EMD for marine current turbines. Zhang, Milu; Wang, Tianzhen; Tang, Tianhao; Benbouzid, Mohamed; Diallo, Demba 2017-05-01 This paper proposes an imbalance fault detection method based on data normalization and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for variable speed direct-drive Marine Current Turbine (MCT) system. The method is based on the MCT stator current under the condition of wave and turbulence. The goal of this method is to extract blade imbalance fault feature, which is concealed by the supply frequency and the environment noise. First, a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) detector is developed and the monitoring variable is selected by analyzing the relationship between the variables. Then, the selected monitoring variable is converted into a time series through data normalization, which makes the imbalance fault characteristic frequency into a constant. At the end, the monitoring variable is filtered out by EMD method to eliminate the effect of turbulence. The experiments show that the proposed method is robust against turbulence through comparing the different fault severities and the different turbulence intensities. Comparison with other methods, the experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method. Copyright © 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Detection, isolation and diagnosability analysis of intermittent faults in stochastic systems NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yan, Rongyi; He, Xiao; Wang, Zidong; Zhou, D. H. 2018-02-01 Intermittent faults (IFs) have the properties of unpredictability, non-determinacy, inconsistency and repeatability, switching systems between faulty and healthy status. In this paper, the fault detection and isolation (FDI) problem of IFs in a class of linear stochastic systems is investigated. For the detection and isolation of IFs, it includes: (1) to detect all the appearing time and the disappearing time of an IF; (2) to detect each appearing (disappearing) time of the IF before the subsequent disappearing (appearing) time; (3) to determine where the IFs happen. Based on the outputs of the observers we designed, a novel set of residuals is constructed by using the sliding-time window technique, and two hypothesis tests are proposed to detect all the appearing time and disappearing time of IFs. The isolation problem of IFs is also considered. Furthermore, within a statistical framework, the definition of the diagnosability of IFs is proposed, and a sufficient condition is brought forward for the diagnosability of IFs. Quantitative performance analysis results for the false alarm rate and missing detection rate are discussed, and the influences of some key parameters of the proposed scheme on performance indices such as the false alarm rate and missing detection rate are analysed rigorously. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated via a simulation example of an unmanned helicopter longitudinal control system.

Data-driven fault detection, isolation and estimation of aircraft gas turbine engine actuator and sensors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). Integrated ensemble noise-reconstructed empirical mode decomposition for mechanical fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yuan, Jing; Ji, Feng; Gao, Yuan; Zhu, Jun; Wei, Chenjun; Zhou, Yu 2018-05-01 A new branch of fault detection is utilizing the noise such as enhancing, adding or estimating the noise so as to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and extract the fault signatures. Hereinto, ensemble noise-reconstructed empirical mode decomposition (ENEMD) is a novel noise utilization method to ameliorate the mode mixing and denoised the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Despite the possibility of superior performance in detecting weak and multiple faults, the method still suffers from the major problems of the user-defined parameter and the powerless capability for a high SNR case. Hence, integrated ensemble noise-reconstructed empirical mode decomposition is proposed to overcome the drawbacks, improved by two noise estimation techniques for different SNRs as well as the noise estimation strategy. Independent from the artificial setup, the noise estimation by the minimax thresholding is improved for a low SNR case, which especially shows an outstanding interpretation for signature enhancement. For approximating the weak noise precisely, the noise estimation by the local reconfiguration using singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed for a high SNR case, which is particularly powerful for reducing the mode mixing. Thereinto, the sliding window for projecting the phase space is optimally designed by the correlation minimization. Meanwhile, the reasonable singular order for the local reconfiguration to estimate the noise is determined by the inflection point of the increment trend of normalized singular entropy. Furthermore, the noise estimation strategy, i.e. the selection approaches of the two estimation techniques along with the critical case, is developed and discussed for different SNRs by means of the possible noise-only IMF family. The method is validated by the repeatable simulations to demonstrate the synthetical performance and especially confirm the capability of noise estimation. Finally, the method is applied to detect the local wear fault 49 CFR 392.66 - Carbon monoxide; use of commercial motor vehicle when detected.

Fault detection for discrete-time LPV systems using interval observers NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zhang, Zhi-Hui; Yang, Guang-Hong 2017-10-01 This paper is concerned with the fault detection (FD) problem for discrete-time linear parameter-varying systems subject to bounded disturbances. A parameter-dependent FD interval observer is designed based on parameter-dependent Lyapunov and slack matrices. The design method is presented by translating the parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) into finite ones. In contrast to the existing results based on parameter-independent and diagonal Lyapunov matrices, the derived disturbance attenuation, fault sensitivity and nonnegative conditions lead to less conservative LMI characterisations. Furthermore, without the need to design the residual evaluation functions and thresholds, the residual intervals generated by the interval observers are used directly for FD decision. Finally, simulation results are presented for showing the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Spontaneous non-volcanic tremor detected in the Anza Seismic Gap of San Jacinto Fault NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Hutchison, A. A.; Ghosh, A. 2017-12-01 Non-volcanic tremor (NVT), a type of slow earthquake, is becoming more frequently detected along plate boundaries, particularly in subduction zones, and is also observed along the San Andreas Fault [e.g. Nadeau &amp; Dolenc, 2005]. NVT is typically associated with transient deformation (i.e. slow slip) in the transition zone [e.g. Ide et al., 2007], and at times it is observed with deep creep along faults [e.g. Beroza &amp; Ide, 2011]. Using several independent location and detection methods including multi-beam backprojection [Ghosh et al., 2009a; 2012], envelope cross correlation [Wech &amp; Creager, 2008], spectral analyses and visual inspection of existing network stations and high-density mini seismic array data, we detect multiple discrete spontaneous tremor events in the Anza Gap of the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) in June, 2011. The events occur on the SJF where the Hot Springs Fault terminates, on the northwestern boundary of the Anza Gap, below the inferred seismogenic zone characterized by velocity weakening frictional behavior [e.g. Lindsay et al., 2014]. The location methods provide consistent locations for each event in our catalog. Low slowness values help rule-out surface noise that may result in false detections. Analyses of frequency spectra show these time windows are depleted in high frequency energy in the displacement amplitude spectrum compared to small local regular (fast) earthquakes. This spectral pattern is characteristic of tremor [Shelly et al., 2007]. We interpret this tremor to be a seismic manifestation of slow-slip events below the seismogenic zone. Recently, an independent geodetic study suggests that the 2010 El Mayor-Cucupah earthquake triggered a slow-slip event in the Anza Gap [Inbal et al., 2017]. In addition, multiple studies infer deep creep in the SJF [e.g. Meng &amp; Peng et al., 2016; Jiang &amp; Fialko, 2016] indicating that this fault is capable of producing slow slip events. Transient tectonic behavior like tremor and slow slip may be playing Real World Experience With Ion Implant Fault Detection at Freescale Semiconductor NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Sing, David C.; Breeden, Terry; Fakhreddine, Hassan; Gladwin, Steven; Locke, Jason; McHugh, Jim; Rendon, Michael 2006-11-01 The Freescale automatic fault detection and classification (FDC) system has logged data from over 3.5 million implants in the past two years. The Freescale FDC system is a low cost system which collects summary implant statistics at the conclusion of each implant run. The data is collected by either downloading implant data log files from the implant tool workstation, or by exporting summary implant statistics through the tool's automation interface. Compared to the traditional FDC systems which gather trace data from sensors on the tool as the implant proceeds, the Freescale FDC system cannot prevent scrap when a fault initially occurs, since the data is collected after the implant concludes. However, the system can prevent catastrophic scrap events due to faults which are not detected for days or weeks, leading to the loss of hundreds or thousands of wafers. At the Freescale ATMC facility, the practical applications of the FD system fall into two categories: PM trigger rules which monitor tool signals such as ion gauges and charge control signals, and scrap prevention rules which are designed to detect specific failure modes that have been correlated to yield loss and scrap. PM trigger rules are designed to detect shifts in tool signals which indicate normal aging of tool systems. For example, charging parameters gradually shift as flood gun assemblies age, and when charge control rules start to fail a flood gun PM is performed. Scrap prevention rules are deployed to detect events such as particle bursts and excessive beam noise, events which have been correlated to yield loss. The FDC system does have tool log-down capability, and scrap prevention rules often use this capability to automatically log the tool into a maintenance state while simultaneously paging the sustaining technician for data review and disposition of the affected product.. Invariant protection of high-voltage electric motors of technological complexes at industrial enterprises at partial single-phase ground faults NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Abramovich, B. N.; Sychev, Yu A.; Pelenev, D. N. 2018-03-01 Development results of invariant protection of high-voltage motors at incomplete single-phase ground faults are observed in the article. It is established that current protections have low action selectivity because of an inadmissible decrease in entrance signals during the shirt circuit occurrence in the place of transient resistance. The structural functional scheme and an algorithm of protective actions where correction of automatic zero sequence currents signals of the protected accessions implemented according to the level of incompleteness of ground faults are developed. It is revealed that automatic correction of zero sequence currents allows one to provide the invariance of sensitivity factor for protection under the variation conditions of a transient resistance in the place of damage. Application of invariant protection allows one to minimize damages in 6-10 kV electrical installations of industrial enterprises for a cause of infringement of consumers’ power supply and their system breakdown due to timely localization of emergency of ground faults modes. Weighted low-rank sparse model via nuclear norm minimization for bearing fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Du, Zhaohui; Chen, Xuefeng; Zhang, Han; Yang, Boyuan; Zhai, Zhi; Yan, Ruqiang 2017-07-01 It is a fundamental task in the machine fault diagnosis community to detect impulsive signatures generated by the localized faults of bearings. The main goal of this paper is to exploit the low-rank physical structure of periodic impulsive features and further establish a weighted low-rank sparse model for bearing fault detection. The proposed model mainly consists of three basic components: an adaptive partition window, a nuclear norm regularization and a weighted sequence. Firstly, due to the periodic repetition mechanism of impulsive feature, an adaptive partition window could be designed to transform the impulsive feature into a data matrix. The highlight of partition window is to accumulate all local feature information and align them. Then, all columns of the data matrix share similar waveforms and a core physical phenomenon arises, i.e., these singular values of the data matrix demonstrates a sparse distribution pattern. Therefore, a nuclear norm regularization is enforced to capture that sparse prior. However, the nuclear norm regularization treats all singular values equally and thus ignores one basic fact that larger singular values have more information volume of impulsive features and should be preserved as much as possible. Therefore, a weighted sequence with adaptively tuning weights inversely proportional to singular amplitude is adopted to guarantee the distribution consistence of large singular values. On the other hand, the proposed model is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and thus a new algorithm is developed to search one satisfying stationary solution through alternatively implementing one proximal operator operation and least-square fitting. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis and selection principles of algorithmic parameters are comprehensively investigated through a set of numerical experiments, which shows that the proposed method is robust and only has a few adjustable parameters. Lastly, the proposed model is applied to the An autonomous fault detection, isolation, and recovery system for a 20-kHz electric power distribution test bed NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Quinn, Todd M.; Walters, Jerry L. 1991-01-01 Future space explorations will require long term human presence in space. Space environments that provide working and living quarters for manned missions are becoming increasingly larger and more sophisticated. Monitor and control of the space environment subsystems by expert system software, which emulate human reasoning processes, could maintain the health of the subsystems and help reduce the human workload. The autonomous power expert (APEX) system was developed to emulate a human expert's reasoning processes used to diagnose fault conditions in the domain of space power distribution. APEX is a fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) system, capable of autonomous monitoring and control of the power distribution system. APEX consists of a knowledge base, a data base, an inference engine, and various support and interface software. APEX provides the user with an easy-to-use interactive interface. When a fault is detected, APEX will inform the user of the detection. The user can direct APEX to isolate the probable cause of the fault. Once a fault has been isolated, the user can ask APEX to justify its fault isolation and to recommend actions to correct the fault. APEX implementation and capabilities are discussed. About the Power Generation Confirmation of the Induction Motor and the Influence on the Islanding Detection Device NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Igarashi, Hironobu; Sato, Takashi; Miyamoto, Kazunori; Kurokawa, Kousuke The photovoltaic generation system must have protection device and islanding detection devices to connect with utility line of the electric power company. It is regulated in the technological requirement guideline and the electric equipment technology standard that the country provides. The islanding detection device detected purpose install for blackout due to the accident occurrence of the earth fault and the short-circuit in the utility line. When the islanding detection device detects the power blackout, it is necessary to stop the photovoltaic generation system immediately. If the photovoltaic generation system is not stopped immediately, electricity comes to charge the utility power line very at risk. We had already known that the islanding detection device can't detect the islanding phenomenon, if is there the induction motor in the loads. Authors decided to investigate the influence that the induction motors gave to the islanding detection device. The result was the load condition that the induction motors changed generator the voltage is restraining. Moreover, it was clarified that the time of the islanding was long compared with the load condition of not changing into the state of the generator. The value changes into the reactance of the induction motors according to the frequency change after the supply of electric power line stops. The frequency after the supply of electric power line stops changes for the unbalance the reactive power by the effect of the power rate constancy control with PLL of the power conditioner. However, the induction motors is also to the changing frequency, makes amends for the amount of reactive power, and the change in the frequency after the supply of electric power line stops as a result is controlled.

L. 1974-01-01 The functional paths of the Orbital Maneuver Subsystem (OMS) is defined. The operational flight instrumentation required for performance monitoring, fault detection, and annunciation is described. The OMS is a pressure fed rocket engine propulsion subsystem. One complete OMS shares each of the two auxiliary propulsion subsystem pods with a reaction control subsystem. Each OMS is composed of a pressurization system, a propellant tanking system, and a gimbaled rocket engine. The design, development, and operation of the system are explained. Diagrams of the system are provided. Using recurrence plot analysis for software execution interpretation and fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mosdorf, M. 2015-09-01 This paper shows a method targeted at software execution interpretation and fault detection using recurrence plot analysis. In in the proposed approach recurrence plot analysis is applied to software execution trace that contains executed assembly instructions. Results of this analysis are subject to further processing with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method that simplifies number coefficients used for software execution classification. This method was used for the analysis of five algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Median Filter, FIR, SHA-1. Results show that some of the collected traces could be easily assigned to particular algorithms (logs from Bubble Sort and FIR algorithms) while others are more difficult to distinguish. Towards Certification of a Space System Application of Fault Detection and Isolation NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Feather, Martin S.; Markosian, Lawrence Z. 2008-01-01 Advanced fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) software is being investigated at NASA as a means to the improve reliability and availability of its space systems. Certification is a critical step in the acceptance of such software. Its attainment hinges on performing the necessary verification and validation to show that the software will fulfill its requirements in the intended setting. Presented herein is our ongoing work to plan for the certification of a pilot application of advanced FDIR software in a NASA setting. We describe the application, and the key challenges and opportunities it offers for certification. Hidden Markov models and neural networks for fault detection in dynamic systems NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Smyth, Padhraic 1994-01-01 Neural networks plus hidden Markov models (HMM) can provide excellent detection and false alarm rate performance in fault detection applications, as shown in this viewgraph presentation. Modified models allow for novelty detection. Key contributions of neural network models are: (1) excellent nonparametric discrimination capability; (2) a good estimator of posterior state probabilities, even in high dimensions, and thus can be embedded within overall probabilistic model (HMM); and (3) simple to implement compared to other nonparametric models. Neural network/HMM monitoring model is currently being integrated with the new Deep Space Network (DSN) antenna controller software and will be on-line monitoring a new DSN 34-m antenna (DSS-24) by July, 1994. Fast computation of the kurtogram for the detection of transient faults NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Antoni, Jérôme 2007-01-01 The kurtogram is a fourth-order spectral analysis tool recently introduced for detecting and characterising non-stationarities in a signal. The paradigm relies on the assertion that each type of transient is associated with an optimal (frequency/frequency resolution) dyad { f,Δf} which maximises its kurtosis, and hence its detection. However, the complete exploration of the whole plane ( f,Δf) is a formidable task hardly amenable to on-line industrial applications. In this communication we describe a fast algorithm for computing the kurtogram over a grid that finely samples the ( f,Δf) plane. Its complexity is on the order of N log N, similarly to the FFT. The efficiency of the algorithm is then illustrated on several industrial cases concerned with the detection of incipient transient faults. Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution and Convolution Fix: Application to vibration fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) McDonald, Geoff L.; Zhao, Qing 2017-01-01 Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been applied successfully to rotating machine fault detection from vibration data, however this method has limitations. A convolution adjustment to the MED definition and solution is proposed in this paper to address the discontinuity at the start of the signal - in some cases causing spurious impulses to be erroneously deconvolved. A problem with the MED solution is that it is an iterative selection process, and will not necessarily design an optimal filter for the posed problem. Additionally, the problem goal in MED prefers to deconvolve a single-impulse, while in rotating machine faults we expect one impulse-like vibration source per rotational period of the faulty element. Maximum Correlated Kurtosis Deconvolution was proposed to address some of these problems, and although it solves the target goal of multiple periodic impulses, it is still an iterative non-optimal solution to the posed problem and only solves for a limited set of impulses in a row. Ideally, the problem goal should target an impulse train as the output goal, and should directly solve for the optimal filter in a non-iterative manner. To meet these goals, we propose a non-iterative deconvolution approach called Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution Adjusted (MOMEDA). MOMEDA proposes a deconvolution problem with an infinite impulse train as the goal and the optimal filter solution can be solved for directly. From experimental data on a gearbox with and without a gear tooth chip, we show that MOMEDA and its deconvolution spectrums according to the period between the impulses can be used to detect faults and study the health of rotating machine elements effectively. Thermal Fault Tolerance Analysis of Carbon Fiber Rope Barrier Systems for Use in the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor ( RSRM) Nozzle Joints NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Clayton, J. Louie; Phelps, Lisa (Technical Monitor) 2001-01-01 Carbon Fiber Rope (CFR) thermal barrier systems are being considered for use in several RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) nozzle joints as a replacement for the current assembly gap close-out process/design. This study provides for development and test verification of analysis methods used for flow-thermal modeling of a CFR thermal barrier subject to fault conditions such as rope combustion gas blow-by and CFR splice failure. Global model development is based on a 1-D (one dimensional) transient volume filling approach where the flow conditions are calculated as a function of internal 'pipe' and porous media 'Darcy' flow correlations. Combustion gas flow rates are calculated for the CFR on a per-linear inch basis and solved simultaneously with a detailed thermal-gas dynamic model of a local region of gas blow by (or splice fault). Effects of gas compressibility, friction and heat transfer are accounted for the model. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solutions of the fault regions are used to characterize the local flow field, quantify the amount of free jet spreading and assist in the determination of impingement film coefficients on the nozzle housings. Gas to wall heat transfer is simulated by a large thermal finite element grid of the local structure. The employed numerical technique loosely couples the FE (Finite Element) solution with the gas dynamics solution of the faulted region. All free constants that appear in the governing equations are calibrated by hot fire sub-scale test. The calibrated model is used to make flight predictions using motor aft end environments and timelines. Model results indicate that CFR barrier systems provide a near 'vented joint' style of pressurization. Hypothetical fault conditions considered in this study (blow by, splice defect) are relatively benign in terms of overall heating to nozzle metal housing structures.

Detection of faults in rotating machinery using periodic time-frequency sparsity NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ding, Yin; He, Wangpeng; Chen, Binqiang; Zi, Yanyang; Selesnick, Ivan W. 2016-11-01 This paper addresses the problem of extracting periodic oscillatory features in vibration signals for detecting faults in rotating machinery. To extract the feature, we propose an approach in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain where the periodic oscillatory feature manifests itself as a relatively sparse grid. To estimate the sparse grid, we formulate an optimization problem using customized binary weights in the regularizer, where the weights are formulated to promote periodicity. In order to solve the proposed optimization problem, we develop an algorithm called augmented Lagrangian majorization-minimization algorithm, which combines the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm (SALSA) with majorization-minimization (MM), and is guaranteed to converge for both convex and non-convex formulation. As examples, the proposed approach is applied to simulated data, and used as a tool for diagnosing faults in bearings and gearboxes for real data, and compared to some state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect and extract the periodical oscillatory features. Fault detection in rotating machines with beamforming: Spatial visualization of diagnosis features NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cardenas Cabada, E.; Leclere, Q.; Antoni, J.; Hamzaoui, N. 2017-12-01 Rotating machines diagnosis is conventionally related to vibration analysis. Sensors are usually placed on the machine to gather information about its components. The recorded signals are then processed through a fault detection algorithm allowing the identification of the failing part. This paper proposes an acoustic-based diagnosis method. A microphone array is used to record the acoustic field radiated by the machine. The main advantage over vibration-based diagnosis is that the contact between the sensors and the machine is no longer required. Moreover, the application of acoustic imaging makes possible the identification of the sources of acoustic radiation on the machine surface. The display of information is then spatially continuous while the accelerometers only give it discrete. Beamforming provides the time-varying signals radiated by the machine as a function of space. Any fault detection tool can be applied to the beamforming output. Spectral kurtosis, which highlights the impulsiveness of a signal as function of frequency, is used in this study. The combination of spectral kurtosis with acoustic imaging makes possible the mapping of the impulsiveness as a function of space and frequency. The efficiency of this approach lays on the source separation in the spatial and frequency domains. These mappings make possible the localization of such impulsive sources. The faulty components of the machine have an impulsive behavior and thus will be highlighted on the mappings. The study presents experimental validations of the method on rotating machines.. PMID:22163766 Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) Portable Liquid Oxygen Hardware Demonstrator NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Oostdyk, Rebecca L.; Perotti, Jose M. 2011-01-01 The Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) hardware demonstration will highlight the effort being conducted by Constellation's Ground Operations (GO) to provide the Launch Control System (LCS) with system-level health management during vehicle processing and countdown activities. A proof-of-concept demonstration of the FDIR prototype established the capability of the software to provide real-time fault detection and isolation using generated Liquid Hydrogen data. The FDIR portable testbed unit (presented here) aims to enhance FDIR by providing a dynamic simulation of Constellation subsystems that feed the FDIR software live data based on Liquid Oxygen system properties. The LO2 cryogenic ground system has key properties that are analogous to the properties of an electronic circuit. The LO2 system is modeled using electrical components and an equivalent circuit is designed on a printed circuit board to simulate the live data. The portable testbed is also be equipped with data acquisition and communication hardware to relay the measurements to the FDIR application running on a PC. This portable testbed is an ideal capability to perform FDIR software testing, troubleshooting, training among others. Early Oscillation Detection for Hybrid DC/DC Converter Fault Diagnosis NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Wang, Bright L. 2011-01-01 This paper describes a novel fault detection technique for hybrid DC/DC converter oscillation diagnosis. The technique is based on principles of feedback control loop oscillation and RF signal modulations, and Is realized by using signal spectral analysis. Real-circuit simulation and analytical study reveal critical factors of the oscillation and indicate significant correlations between the spectral analysis method and the gain/phase margin method. A stability diagnosis index (SDI) is developed as a quantitative measure to accurately assign a degree of stability to the DC/DC converter. This technique Is capable of detecting oscillation at an early stage without interfering with DC/DC converter's normal operation and without limitations of probing to the converter. Lessons Learned on Implementing Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) in a Ground Launch Environment NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Ferrell, Bob A.; Lewis, Mark E.; Perotti, Jose M.; Brown, Barbara L.; Oostdyk, Rebecca L.; Goetz, Jesse W. 2010-01-01 This paper's main purpose is to detail issues and lessons learned regarding designing, integrating, and implementing Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) for Constellation Exploration Program (CxP) Ground Operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Part of the0 overall implementation of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) CxP, FDIR is being implemented in three main components of the program (Ares, Orion, and Ground Operations/Processing). While not initially part of the design baseline for the CxP Ground Operations, NASA felt that FDIR is important enough to develop, that NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate's (ESMD's) Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) initiated a task for it under their Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) research area. This task, referred to as the FDIIR project, is a multi-year multi-center effort. The primary purpose of the FDIR project is to develop a prototype and pathway upon which Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) may be transitioned into the Ground Operations baseline. Currently, Qualtech Systems Inc (QSI) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software products Testability Engineering and Maintenance System (TEAMS) Designer and TEAMS RDS/RT are being utilized in the implementation of FDI within the FDIR project. The TEAMS Designer COTS software product is being utilized to model the system with Functional Fault Models (FFMs). A limited set of systems in Ground Operations are being modeled by the FDIR project, and the entire Ares Launch Vehicle is being modeled under the Functional Fault Analysis (FFA) project at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Integration of the Ares FFMs and the Ground Processing FFMs is being done under the FDIR project also utilizing the TEAMS Designer COTS software product. One of the most significant challenges related to integration is to ensure that FFMs developed by different organizations can be integrated easily and without errors. Software Interface Performance analysis of a fault inferring nonlinear detection system algorithm with integrated avionics flight data NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Caglayan, A. K.; Godiwala, P. M.; Morrell, F. R. 1985-01-01 This paper presents the performance analysis results of a fault inferring nonlinear detection system (FINDS) using integrated avionics sensor flight data for the NASA ATOPS B-737 aircraft in a Microwave Landing System (MLS) environment. First, an overview of the FINDS algorithm structure is given. Then, aircraft state estimate time histories and statistics for the flight data sensors are discussed. This is followed by an explanation of modifications made to the detection and decision functions in FINDS to improve false alarm and failure detection performance. Next, the failure detection and false alarm performance of the FINDS algorithm are analyzed by injecting bias failures into fourteen sensor outputs over six repetitive runs of the five minutes of flight data. Results indicate that the detection speed, failure level estimation, and false alarm performance show a marked improvement over the previously reported simulation runs. In agreement with earlier results, detection speed is faster for filter measurement sensors such as MLS than for filter input sensors such as flight control accelerometers. Finally, the progress in modifications of the FINDS algorithm design to accommodate flight computer constraints is discussed.

A single dynamic observer-based module for design of simultaneous fault detection, isolation and tracking control scheme NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Davoodi, M.; Meskin, N.; Khorasani, K. 2018-03-01 The problem of simultaneous fault detection, isolation and tracking (SFDIT) control design for linear systems subject to both bounded energy and bounded peak disturbances is considered in this work. A dynamic observer is proposed and implemented by using the H∞/H-/L1 formulation of the SFDIT problem. A single dynamic observer module is designed that generates the residuals as well as the control signals. The objective of the SFDIT module is to ensure that simultaneously the effects of disturbances and control signals on the residual signals are minimised (in order to accomplish the fault detection goal) subject to the constraint that the transfer matrix from the faults to the residuals is equal to a pre-assigned diagonal transfer matrix (in order to accomplish the fault isolation goal), while the effects of disturbances, reference inputs and faults on the specified control outputs are minimised (in order to accomplish the fault-tolerant and tracking control goals). A set of linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility conditions are derived to ensure solvability of the problem. In order to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design methodology, the developed and proposed schemes are applied to an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle (AUV). Fault detection for singular switched linear systems with multiple time-varying delay in finite frequency domain NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zhai, Ding; Lu, Anyang; Li, Jinghao; Zhang, Qingling 2016-10-01 This paper deals with the problem of the fault detection (FD) for continuous-time singular switched linear systems with multiple time-varying delay. In this paper, the actuator fault is considered. Besides, the systems faults and unknown disturbances are assumed in known frequency domains. Some finite frequency performance indices are initially introduced to design the switched FD filters which ensure that the filtering augmented systems under switching signal with average dwell time are exponentially admissible and guarantee the fault input sensitivity and disturbance robustness. By developing generalised Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov lemma and using Parseval's theorem and Fourier transform, finite frequency delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter which can guarantee the finite-frequency H- and H∞ performance are derived and formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Four examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed finite frequency method.. Motion-Based System Identification and Fault Detection and Isolation Technologies for Thruster Controlled Spacecraft NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Wilson, Edward; Sutter, David W.; Berkovitz, Dustin; Betts, Bradley J.; Kong, Edmund; delMundo, Rommel; Lages, Christopher R.; Mah, Robert W.; Papasin, Richard 2003-01-01 By analyzing the motions of a thruster-controlled spacecraft, it is possible to provide on-line (1) thruster fault detection and isolation (FDI), and (2) vehicle mass- and thruster-property identification (ID). Technologies developed recently at NASA Ames have significantly improved the speed and accuracy of these ID and FDI capabilities, making them feasible for application to a broad class of spacecraft. Since these technologies use existing sensors, the improved system robustness and performance that comes with the thruster fault tolerance and system ID can be achieved through a software-only implementation. This contrasts with the added cost, mass, and hardware complexity commonly required by FDI. Originally developed in partnership with NASA - Johnson Space Center to provide thruster FDI capability for the X-38 during re-entry, these technologies are most recently being applied to the MIT SPHERES experimental spacecraft to fly on the International Space Station in 2004. The model-based FDI uses a maximum-likelihood calculation at its core, while the ID is based upon recursive least squares estimation. Flight test results from the SPHERES implementation, as flown aboard the NASA KC-1 35A 0-g simulator aircraft in November 2003 are presented.

PMID:25196008 Detection and localization of building insulation faults using optical-fiber DTS system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Papes, Martin; Liner, Andrej; Koudelka, Petr; Siska, Petr; Cubik, Jakub; Kepak, Stanislav; Jaros, Jakub; Vasinek, Vladimir 2013-05-01 Nowadays the trends in the construction industry are changing at an incredible speed. The new technologies are still emerging on the market. Sphere of building insulation is not an exception as well. One of the major problems in building insulation is usually its failure, whether caused by unwanted mechanical intervention or improper installation. The localization of these faults is quite difficult, often impossible without large intervention into the construction. As a proper solution for this problem might be utilization of Optical-Fiber DTS system based on stimulated Raman scattering. Used DTS system is primary designed for continuous measurement of the temperature along the optical fiber. This system is using standard optical fiber as a sensor, which brings several advantages in its application. First, the optical fiber is relatively inexpensive, which allows to cover a quite large area for a small cost. The other main advantages of the optical fiber are electromagnetic resistance, small size, safety operation in inflammable or explosive area, easy installation, etc. This article is dealing with the detection and localization of building insulation faults using mentioned system. Minimum entropy deconvolution optimized sinusoidal synthesis and its application to vibration based fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Li, Gang; Zhao, Qing 2017-03-01 In this paper, a minimum entropy deconvolution based sinusoidal synthesis (MEDSS) filter is proposed to improve the fault detection performance of the regular sinusoidal synthesis (SS) method. The SS filter is an efficient linear predictor that exploits the frequency properties during model construction. The phase information of the harmonic components is not used in the regular SS filter. However, the phase relationships are important in differentiating noise from characteristic impulsive fault signatures. Therefore, in this work, the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) technique is used to optimize the SS filter during the model construction process. A time-weighted-error Kalman filter is used to estimate the MEDSS model parameters adaptively. Three simulation examples and a practical application case study are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The regular SS method and the autoregressive MED (ARMED) method are also implemented for comparison. The MEDSS model has demonstrated superior performance compared to the regular SS method and it also shows comparable or better performance with much less computational intensity than the ARMED method. Fault detection and isolation of high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack under the influence of degradation NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jeppesen, Christian; Araya, Samuel Simon; Sahlin, Simon Lennart; Thomas, Sobi; Andreasen, Søren Juhl; Kær, Søren Knudsen 2017-08-01 This study proposes a data-drive impedance-based methodology for fault detection and isolation of low and high cathode stoichiometry, high CO concentration in the anode gas, high methanol vapour concentrations in the anode gas and low anode stoichiometry, for high temperature PEM fuel cells. The fault detection and isolation algorithm is based on an artificial neural network classifier, which uses three extracted features as input. Two of the proposed features are based on angles in the impedance spectrum, and are therefore relative to specific points, and shown to be independent of degradation, contrary to other available feature extraction methods in the literature. The experimental data is based on a 35 day experiment, where 2010 unique electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded. The test of the algorithm resulted in a good detectability of the faults, except for high methanol vapour concentration in the anode gas fault, which was found to be difficult to distinguish from a normal operational data. The achieved accuracy for faults related to CO pollution, anode- and cathode stoichiometry is 100% success rate. Overall global accuracy on the test data is 94.6%.

Phase editing as a signal pre-processing step for automated bearing fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Barbini, L.; Ompusunggu, A. P.; Hillis, A. J.; du Bois, J. L.; Bartic, A. 2017-07-01 Scheduled maintenance and inspection of bearing elements in industrial machinery contributes significantly to the operating costs. Savings can be made through automatic vibration-based damage detection and prognostics, to permit condition-based maintenance. However automation of the detection process is difficult due to the complexity of vibration signals in realistic operating environments. The sensitivity of existing methods to the choice of parameters imposes a requirement for oversight from a skilled operator. This paper presents a novel approach to the removal of unwanted vibrational components from the signal: phase editing. The approach uses a computationally-efficient full-band demodulation and requires very little oversight. Its effectiveness is tested on experimental data sets from three different test-rigs, and comparisons are made with two state-of-the-art processing techniques: spectral kurtosis and cepstral pre- whitening. The results from the phase editing technique show a 10% improvement in damage detection rates compared to the state-of-the-art while simultaneously improving on the degree of automation. This outcome represents a significant contribution in the pursuit of fully automatic fault detection. Preliminary Study on Acoustic Detection of Faults Experienced by a High-Bypass Turbofan Engine NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Boyle, Devin K. 2014-01-01 The vehicle integrated propulsion research (VIPR) effort conducted by NASA and several partners provided an unparalleled opportunity to test a relatively low TRL concept regarding the use of far field acoustics to identify faults occurring in a high bypass turbofan engine. Though VIPR Phase II ground based aircraft installed engine testing wherein a multitude of research sensors and methods were evaluated, an array of acoustic microphones was used to determine the viability of such an array to detect failures occurring in a commercially representative high bypass turbofan engine. The failures introduced during VIPR testing included commanding the engine's low pressure compressor (LPC) exit and high pressure compressor (HPC) 14th stage bleed values abruptly to their failsafe positions during steady state. Evaluation of an expert system for fault detection, isolation, and recovery in the manned maneuvering unit NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Rushby, John; Crow, Judith 1990-01-01 The authors explore issues in the specification, verification, and validation of artificial intelligence (AI) based software, using a prototype fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) system for the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU). They use this system as a vehicle for exploring issues in the semantics of C-Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS)-style rule-based languages, the verification of properties relating to safety and reliability, and the static and dynamic analysis of knowledge based systems. This analysis reveals errors and shortcomings in the MMU FDIR system and raises a number of issues concerning software engineering in CLIPs. The authors came to realize that the MMU FDIR system does not conform to conventional definitions of AI software, despite the fact that it was intended and indeed presented as an AI system. The authors discuss this apparent disparity and related questions such as the role of AI techniques in space and aircraft operations and the suitability of CLIPS for critical applications. A Fuzzy Reasoning Design for Fault Detection and Diagnosis of a Computer-Controlled System Ting, Y.; Lu, W.B.; Chen, C.H.; Wang, G.K. 2008-01-01 A Fuzzy Reasoning and Verification Petri Nets (FRVPNs) model is established for an error detection and diagnosis mechanism (EDDM) applied to a complex fault-tolerant PC-controlled system. The inference accuracy can be improved through the hierarchical design of a two-level fuzzy rule decision tree (FRDT) and a Petri nets (PNs) technique to transform the fuzzy rule into the FRVPNs model. Several simulation examples of the assumed failure events were carried out by using the FRVPNs and the Mamdani fuzzy method with MATLAB tools. The reasoning performance of the developed FRVPNs was verified by comparing the inference outcome to that of the Mamdani method. Both methods result in the same conclusions. Thus, the present study demonstratrates that the proposed FRVPNs model is able to achieve the purpose of reasoning, and furthermore, determining of the failure event of the monitored application program. PMID:19255619 Test Generation Algorithm for Fault Detection of Analog Circuits Based on Extreme Learning Machine Zhou, Jingyu; Tian, Shulin; Yang, Chenglin; Ren, Xuelong 2014-01-01 This paper proposes a novel test generation algorithm based on extreme learning machine (ELM), and such algorithm is cost-effective and low-risk for analog device under test (DUT). This method uses test patterns derived from the test generation algorithm to stimulate DUT, and then samples output responses of the DUT for fault classification and detection. The novel ELM-based test generation algorithm proposed in this paper contains mainly three aspects of innovation. Firstly, this algorithm saves time efficiently by classifying response space with ELM. Secondly, this algorithm can avoid reduced test precision efficiently in case of reduction of the number of impulse-response samples. Thirdly, a new process of test signal generator and a test structure in test generation algorithm are presented, and both of them are very simple. Finally, the abovementioned improvement and functioning are confirmed in experiments. PMID:25610458 Fault detection in heavy duty wheels by advanced vibration processing techniques and lumped parameter modeling NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Malago`, M.; Mucchi, E.; Dalpiaz, G. 2016-03-01 Heavy duty wheels are used in applications such as automatic vehicles and are mainly composed of a polyurethane tread glued to a cast iron hub. In the manufacturing process, the adhesive application between tread and hub is a critical assembly phase, since it is completely made by an operator and a contamination of the bond area may happen. Furthermore, the presence of rust on the hub surface can contribute to worsen the adherence interface, reducing the operating life. In this scenario, a quality control procedure for fault detection to be used at the end of the manufacturing process has been developed. This procedure is based on vibration processing techniques and takes advantages of the results of a lumped parameter model. Indicators based on cyclostationarity can be considered as key parameters to be adopted in a monitoring test station at the end of the production line due to their not deterministic characteristics.

Amozegar, M; Khorasani, K 2016-04-01 In this paper, a new approach for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of gas turbine engines is proposed by developing an ensemble of dynamic neural network identifiers. For health monitoring of the gas turbine engine, its dynamics is first identified by constructing three separate or individual dynamic neural network architectures. Specifically, a dynamic multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a dynamic radial-basis function (RBF) neural network, and a dynamic support vector machine (SVM) are trained to individually identify and represent the gas turbine engine dynamics. Next, three ensemble-based techniques are developed to represent the gas turbine engine dynamics, namely, two heterogeneous ensemble models and one homogeneous ensemble model. It is first shown that all ensemble approaches do significantly improve the overall performance and accuracy of the developed system identification scheme when compared to each of the stand-alone solutions. The best selected stand-alone model (i.e., the dynamic RBF network) and the best selected ensemble architecture (i.e., the heterogeneous ensemble) in terms of their performances in achieving an accurate system identification are then selected for solving the FDI task. The required residual signals are generated by using both a single model-based solution and an ensemble-based solution under various gas turbine engine health conditions. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the fault detection and isolation task achieved by using the residuals that are obtained from the dynamic ensemble scheme results in a significantly more accurate and reliable performance as illustrated through detailed quantitative confusion matrix analysis and comparative studies.

Estimation of fault geometry of a slow slip event off the Kii Peninsula, southwest of Japan, detected by DONET NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Suzuki, K.; Nakano, M.; Hori, T.; Takahashi, N. 2015-12-01 The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology installed permanent ocean bottom observation network called Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) off the Kii Peninsula, southwest of Japan, to monitor earthquakes and tsunamis. We detected the long-term vertical displacements of sea floor from the ocean-bottom pressure records, starting from March 2013, at several DONET stations (Suzuki et al., 2014). We consider that these displacements were caused by the crustal deformation due to a slow slip event (SSE). We estimated the fault geometry of the SSE by using the observed ocean-bottom displacements. The ocean-bottom displacements were obtained by removing the tidal components from the pressure records. We also subtracted the average of pressure changes taken over the records at stations connected to each science node from each record in order to remove the contributions due to atmospheric pressure changes and non-tidal ocean dynamic mass variations. Therefore we compared observed displacements with the theoretical ones that was subtracted the average displacement in the fault geometry estimation. We also compared observed and theoretical average displacements for the model evaluation. In this study, the observed average displacements were assumed to be zero. Although there are nine parameters in the fault model, we observed vertical displacements at only four stations. Therefore we assumed three fault geometries; (1) a reverse fault slip along the plate boundary, (2) a strike slip along a splay fault, and (3) a reverse fault slip along the splay fault. We obtained that the model (3) gives the smallest residual between observed and calculated displacements. We also observed that this SSE was synchronized with a decrease in the background seismicity within the area of a nearby earthquake cluster.

Final Technical Report Recovery Act: Online Nonintrusive Condition Monitoring and Fault Detection for Wind Turbines Wei Qiao 2012-05-29 The penetration of wind power has increased greatly over the last decade in the United States and across the world. The U.S. wind power industry installed 1,118 MW of new capacity in the first quarter of 2011 alone and entered the second quarter with another 5,600 MW under construction. By 2030, wind energy is expected to provide 20% of the U.S. electricity needs. As the number of wind turbines continues to grow, the need for effective condition monitoring and fault detection (CMFD) systems becomes increasingly important [3]. Online CMFD is an effective means of not only improving the reliability, capacitymore » factor, and lifetime, but it also reduces the downtime, energy loss, and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of wind turbines. The goal of this project is to develop novel online nonintrusive CMFD technologies for wind turbines. The proposed technologies use only the current measurements that have been used by the control and protection system of a wind turbine generator (WTG); no additional sensors or data acquisition devices are needed. Current signals are reliable and easily accessible from the ground without intruding on the wind turbine generators (WTGs) that are situated on high towers and installed in remote areas. Therefore, current-based CMFD techniques have great economic benefits and the potential to be adopted by the wind energy industry. Specifically, the following objectives and results have been achieved in this project: (1) Analyzed the effects of faults in a WTG on the generator currents of the WTG operating at variable rotating speed conditions from the perspective of amplitude and frequency modulations of the current measurements; (2) Developed effective amplitude and frequency demodulation methods for appropriate signal conditioning of the current measurements to improve the accuracy and reliability of wind turbine CMFD; (3) Developed a 1P-invariant power spectrum density (PSD) method for effective signature extraction of wind turbine Fault detection and accommodation testing on an F100 engine in an F-15 airplane. [digital engine control system NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Myers, L. P.; Baer-Riedhart, J. L.; Maxwell, M. D. 1985-01-01 The fault detection and accommodation (FDA) methods that can be used for digital engine control systems are presently subjected to a flight test program in the case of the F-15 fighter's F100 engine electronic controls, inducing selected faults and then evaluating the resulting digital engine control responses. In general, flight test results were found to compare well with both ground tests and predictions. It is noted that the inducement of dual-pressure failures was not feasible, since FDA logic was not designed to accommodate them. Selective detection and characterization of nanoparticles from motor vehicles. Johnston, Murray V; Klems, Joseph P; Zordan, Christopher A; Pennington, M Ross; Smith, James N 2013-02-01 Numerous studies have shown that exposure to motor vehicle emissions increases the probability of heart attacks, asthma attacks, and hospital visits among at-risk individuals. However, while many studies have focused on measurements of ambient nanoparticles near highways, they have not focused on specific road-level domains, such as intersections near population centers. At these locations, very intense spikes in particle number concentration have been observed. These spikes have been linked to motor vehicle activity and have the potential to increase exposure dramatically. Characterizing both the contribution and composition of these spikes is critical in developing exposure models and abatement strategies. To determine the contribution of the particle spikes to the ambient number concentration, we implemented wavelet-based algorithms to isolate the particle spikes from measurements taken during the summer and winter of 2009 in Wilmington, Delaware, adjacent to a roadway intersection that approximately 28,000 vehicles pass through daily. These measurements included both number concentration and size distributions recorded once every second by a condensation particle counter (CPC*; TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN) and a fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS). The high-frequency portion of the signal, consisting of a series of abrupt spikes in number concentration that varied in length from a few seconds to tens of seconds, accounted for 3% to 35% of the daily ambient number concentration, with spike contributions sometimes greater than 50% of hourly number concentrations. When the data were weighted by particle volume, this portion of the signal contributed an average of 10% to 20% to the daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) &lt; or = 0.1 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM0.1). The preferred locations for observing particle concentration spikes were those surrounding the measurement site at which motor vehicles accelerated after a red traffic light turned green.

The association between attributions of responsibility for motor vehicle accidents and patient satisfaction: a study within a no-fault injury compensation system. Thompson, Jason; Berk, Michael; O'Donnell, Meaghan; Stafford, Lesley; Nordfjaern, Trond 2015-05-01 This study set out to test the relationship between attributions of responsibility for motor vehicle accidents and satisfaction with personal injury compensation systems. The study analysed survey data from 1394 people injured in a motor vehicle accident who were compensated under a no-fault personal injury compensation system. Patients' ratings of satisfaction with the compensation system across five domains (resolves your issues, keeps you up-to-date, treats you as an individual, cares about you, and overall satisfaction) were analysed alongside patient attributions of responsibility for their accident (not responsible, partly responsible, totally responsible). Postaccident physical and mental health status, age, gender, and duration of compensation claim were controlled for in the analysis. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated attributions of responsibility for accidents were significantly associated with levels of patient satisfaction across all five domains under study (F (10, 2084) = 3.7, p&lt;0.001, η(2) =0.02). Despite access to virtually indistinguishable services, patients who attributed responsibility for their accidents to others were significantly less satisfied with the injury compensation system than those who attributed responsibility to themselves. Satisfaction with no-fault motor vehicle injury compensation services are associated with patients' attributions of responsibility for their accident. Compensation systems and other rehabilitation services monitoring patient satisfaction should adjust for attributions of responsibility when assessing levels of patient satisfaction between time periods, services, or injured populations. Differences in levels of patient satisfaction observed between compensation or rehabilitation populations may reflect differences in attributions of responsibility for accidents rather than objective service quality. © The Author(s) 2014.-01-01 Purpose To examine whether an objective segmenation of corticospinal tract (CST) associated with hand and leg movements can be used to detect central motor weakness in the corresponding extremities in a pediatric population.

An optimized ensemble local mean decomposition method for fault detection of mechanical components NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zhang, Chao; Li, Zhixiong; Hu, Chao; Chen, Shuai; Wang, Jianguo; Zhang, Xiaogang 2017-03-01 Mechanical transmission systems have been widely adopted in most of industrial applications, and issues related to the maintenance of these systems have attracted considerable attention in the past few decades. The recently developed ensemble local mean decomposition (ELMD) method shows satisfactory performance in fault detection of mechanical components for preventing catastrophic failures and reducing maintenance costs. However, the performance of ELMD often heavily depends on proper selection of its model parameters. To this end, this paper proposes an optimized ensemble local mean decomposition (OELMD) method to determinate an optimum set of ELMD parameters for vibration signal analysis. In OELMD, an error index termed the relative root-mean-square error (Relative RMSE) is used to evaluate the decomposition performance of ELMD with a certain amplitude of the added white noise. Once a maximum Relative RMSE, corresponding to an optimal noise amplitude, is determined, OELMD then identifies optimal noise bandwidth and ensemble number based on the Relative RMSE and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), respectively. Thus, all three critical parameters of ELMD (i.e. noise amplitude and bandwidth, and ensemble number) are optimized by OELMD. The effectiveness of OELMD was evaluated using experimental vibration signals measured from three different mechanical components (i.e. the rolling bearing, gear and diesel engine) under faulty operation conditions.

L.; Shuchman, R. A.; Wagner, H.; Ruskey, F. 1977-01-01 Remote sensing was included in a comprehensive investigation of the use of geophysical techniques to aid in underground mine placement. The primary objective was to detect faults and slumping, features which, due to structural weakness and excess water, cause construction difficulties and safety hazards in mine construction. Preliminary geologic reconnaissance was performed on a potential site for an underground oil shale mine in the Piceance Creek Basin of Colorado. LANDSAT data, black and white aerial photography and 3 cm radar imagery were obtained. LANDSAT data were primarily used in optical imagery and digital tape forms, both of which were analyzed and enhanced by computer techniques. The aerial photography and radar data offered supplemental information. Surface linears in the test area were located and mapped principally from LANDSAT data. A specific, relatively wide, linear pointed directly toward the test site, but did not extend into it. Density slicing, ratioing, and edge enhancement of the LANDSAT data all indicated the existence of this linear. Radar imagery marginally confirmed the linear, while aerial photography did not confirm it.. User's guide to the Fault Inferring Nonlinear Detection System (FINDS) computer program NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Caglayan, A. K.; Godiwala, P. M.; Satz, H. S. 1988-01-01 Described are the operation and internal structure of the computer program FINDS (Fault Inferring Nonlinear Detection System). The FINDS algorithm is designed to provide reliable estimates for aircraft position, velocity, attitude, and horizontal winds to be used for guidance and control laws in the presence of possible failures in the avionics sensors. The FINDS algorithm was developed with the use of a digital simulation of a commercial transport aircraft and tested with flight recorded data. The algorithm was then modified to meet the size constraints and real-time execution requirements on a flight computer. For the real-time operation, a multi-rate implementation of the FINDS algorithm has been partitioned to execute on a dual parallel processor configuration: one based on the translational dynamics and the other on the rotational kinematics. The report presents an overview of the FINDS algorithm, the implemented equations, the flow charts for the key subprograms, the input and output files, program variable indexing convention, subprogram descriptions, and the common block descriptions used in the program. Detection of air-gap eccentricity and broken-rotor bar conditions in a squirrel-cage induction motor using the radial flux sensor Hwang, Don-Ha; Woo, Byung-Chul; Sun, Jong-Ho 2008-04-01 A new method for detecting eccentricity and broken rotor bar conditions in a squirrel-cage induction motor is proposed. Air-gap flux variation analysis is done using search coils, which are inserted at stator slots. Using this method, the leakage flux in radial direction can be directly detected. Using finite element method, the air-gap flux variation is accurately modeled and analyzed. From the results of the simulation, a motor under normal condition shows maximum magnetic flux density of 1.3 T. On the other hand, the eccentric air-gap condition displays about 1.1 T at 60 deg. and 1.6 T at 240 deg.

J.; Smith, M. 2016-12-01 (µ Fault detection on a sewer network by a combination of a Kalman filter and a binary sequential probability ratio test NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Piatyszek, E.; Voignier, P.; Graillot, D. 2000-05-01 One of the aims of sewer networks is the protection of population against floods and the reduction of pollution rejected to the receiving water during rainy events. To meet these goals, managers have to equip the sewer networks with and to set up real-time control systems. Unfortunately, a component fault (leading to intolerable behaviour of the system) or sensor fault (deteriorating the process view and disturbing the local automatism) makes the sewer network supervision delicate. In order to ensure an adequate flow management during rainy events it is essential to set up procedures capable of detecting and diagnosing these anomalies. This article introduces a real-time fault detection method, applicable to sewer networks, for the follow-up of rainy events. This method consists in comparing the sensor response with a forecast of this response. This forecast is provided by a model and more precisely by a state estimator: a Kalman filter. This Kalman filter provides not only a flow estimate but also an entity called 'innovation'. In order to detect abnormal operations within the network, this innovation is analysed with the binary sequential probability ratio test of Wald. Moreover, by crossing available information on several nodes of the network, a diagnosis of the detected anomalies is carried out. This method provided encouraging results during the analysis of several rains, on the sewer network of Seine-Saint-Denis County, France. Development of a variable structure-based fault detection and diagnosis strategy applied to an electromechanical system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Gadsden, S. Andrew; Kirubarajan, T. 2017-05-01 Signal processing techniques are prevalent in a wide range of fields: control, target tracking, telecommunications, robotics, fault detection and diagnosis, and even stock market analysis, to name a few. Although first introduced in the 1950s, the most popular method used for signal processing and state estimation remains the Kalman filter (KF). The KF offers an optimal solution to the estimation problem under strict assumptions. Since this time, a number of other estimation strategies and filters were introduced to overcome robustness issues, such as the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF). In this paper, properties of the SVSF are explored in an effort to detect and diagnosis faults in an electromechanical system. The results are compared with the KF method, and future work is discussed.

Multi-Fault Detection of Rolling Element Bearings under Harsh Working Condition Using IMF-Based Adaptive Envelope Order Analysis Zhao, Ming; Lin, Jing; Xu, Xiaoqiang; Li, Xuejun 2014-01-01 When operating under harsh condition (e.g., time-varying speed and load, large shocks), the vibration signals of rolling element bearings are always manifested as low signal noise ratio, non-stationary statistical parameters, which cause difficulties for current diagnostic methods. As such, an IMF-based adaptive envelope order analysis (IMF-AEOA) is proposed for bearing fault detection under such conditions. This approach is established through combining the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), envelope order tracking and fault sensitive analysis. In this scheme, EEMD provides an effective way to adaptively decompose the raw vibration signal into IMFs with different frequency bands. The envelope order tracking is further employed to transform the envelope of each IMF to angular domain to eliminate the spectral smearing induced by speed variation, which makes the bearing characteristic frequencies more clear and discernible in the envelope order spectrum. Finally, a fault sensitive matrix is established to select the optimal IMF containing the richest diagnostic information for final decision making. The effectiveness of IMF-AEOA is validated by simulated signal and experimental data from locomotive bearings. The result shows that IMF-AEOA could accurately identify both single and multiple faults of bearing even under time-varying rotating speed and large extraneous shocks. PMID:25353982 Syntectonic Mississippi River Channel Response: Integrating River Morphology and Seismic Imaging to Detect Active Faults NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Magnani, M. B. 2017-12-01 Alluvial rivers, even great rivers such as the Mississippi, respond to hydrologic and geologic controls. Temporal variations of valley gradient can significantly alter channel morphology, as the river responds syntectonically to attain equilibrium. The river will alter its sinuosity, in an attempt to maintain a constant gradient on a surface that changes slope through time. Therefore, changes of river pattern can be the first clue that active tectonics is affecting an area of pattern change. Here I present geomorphological and seismic imaging evidence of a previously unknown fault crossing the Mississippi river south of the New Madrid seismic zone, between Caruthersville, Missouri and Osceola, Arkansas, and show that both datasets support Holocene fault movement, with the latest slip occurring in the last 200 years. High resolution marine seismic reflection data acquired along the Mississippi river imaged a NW-SE striking north-dipping fault displacing the base of the Quaternary alluvium by 15 m with reverse sense of movement. The fault consistently deforms the Tertiary, Cretaceous and Paleozoic formations. Historical river channel planforms dating back to 1765 reveal that the section of the river channel across the fault has been characterized by high sinuosity and steep projected-channel slope compared to adjacent river reaches. In particular, the reach across the fault experienced a cutoff in 1821, resulting in a temporary lowering of sinuosity followed by an increase between the survey of 1880 and 1915. Under the assumption that the change in sinuosity reflects river response to a valley slope change to maintain constant gradient, I use sinuosity through time to calculate the change in valley slope since 1880 and therefore to estimate the vertical displacement of the imaged fault in the past 200 years. Based on calculations so performed, the vertical offset of the fault is estimated to be 0.4 m, accrued since at least 1880. If the base of the river alluvium New procedure for gear fault detection and diagnosis using instantaneous angular speed NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Li, Bing; Zhang, Xining; Wu, Jili 2017-02-01 Besides the extreme complexity of gear dynamics, the fault diagnosis results in terms of vibration signal are sometimes easily misled and even distorted by the interference of transmission channel or other components like bearings, bars. Recently, the research field of Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) has attracted significant attentions due to its own advantages over conventional vibration analysis. On the basis of IAS signal's advantages, this paper presents a new feature extraction method by combining the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Autocorrelation Local Cepstrum (ALC) for fault diagnosis of sophisticated multistage gearbox. Firstly, as a pre-processing step, signal reconstruction is employed to address the oversampled issue caused by the high resolution of the angular sensor and the test speed. Then the adaptive EMD is used to acquire a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Nevertheless, not all the IMFs are needed for the further analysis since different IMFs have different sensitivities to fault. Hence, the cosine similarity metric is introduced to select the most sensitive IMF. Even though, the sensitive IMF is still insufficient for the gear fault diagnosis due to the weakness of the fault component related to the gear fault. Therefore, as the final step, ALC is used for the purpose of signal de-noising and feature extraction. The effectiveness and robustness of the new approach has been validated experimentally on the basis of two gear test rigs with gears under different working conditions. Diagnosis results show that the new approach is capable of effectively handling the gear fault diagnosis i.e., the highlighted quefrency and its rahmonics corresponding to the rotary period and its multiple are displayed clearly in the cepstrum record of the proposed method.

Detection of postseismic fault-zone collapse following the Landers earthquake NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Massonnet, Didier; Thatcher, Wayne; Vadon, Hélèna 1996-08-01 STRESS changes caused by fault movement in an earthquake induce transient aseismic crustal movements in the earthquake source region that continue for months to decades following large events1-4. These motions reflect aseismic adjustments of the fault zone and/or bulk deformation of the surroundings in response to applied stresses2,5-7, and supply information regarding the inelastic behaviour of the Earth's crust. These processes are imperfectly understood because it is difficult to infer what occurs at depth using only surface measurements2,6-8. Using Near Surface P and S Wave Velocities and Seismic Reflection Images to Detect the Westerly Extension of the Active Meishan Fault in Southwestern Taiwan NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Putriani, E.; Huang, W. H.; Shih, R. C. 2017-12-01 The Southwestern Taiwan has higher potential seismic risks among the island. In 1906 the Meishan earthquake of magnitude 7.1 caused very severe damages. The associated Meishan fault was believed extended from Meishan westerly to Hsingang area for 23 km long; however, only the eastern part of the fault could be traces on the surface. The western part of the Meishan fault was simply proposed from the observed lineation of sand blow from the middle of the fault, the Minhsiung area westerly to the Hsingang area. The purpose of this paper is hope to prove the extension of this fault by using near surface P wave and S wave velocities and the seismic reflection images acquired across the suspicious fault location. Totally, we have conducted 20 seismic velocity survey lines, which were deployed in six areas with and without liquefaction observed, and 2 seismic reflection lines. The P and S wave velocities variations were used to analyze depth of the water table, the elastic modulus, soil porosity and the safety factor for soil liquefaction assessment. Preliminary result of the seismic velocity distribution was effective within 17 m deep from surface and showed no particular difference at the sites of liquefaction observed or no liquefaction. The results could indicate that the sand blow observed in 1906 were not site dependent, but more likely related to activity of the Meishan fault. In order to detect the detailed fault trace, the seismic reflection images will be combined for interpreting the buried Meishan fault in the final result..

Methods Abnormal spontaneous high frequency motor fibre activity is a sensitive and specific endpoint of acute oxaliplatin-induced motor nerve hyperexcitability, detectable A new iterative approach for multi-objective fault detection observer design and its application to a hypersonic vehicle NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Huang, Di; Duan, Zhisheng 2018-03-01 This paper addresses the multi-objective fault detection observer design problems for a hypersonic vehicle. Owing to the fact that parameters' variations, modelling errors and disturbances are inevitable in practical situations, system uncertainty is considered in this study. By fully utilising the orthogonal space information of output matrix, some new understandings are proposed for the construction of Lyapunov matrix. Sufficient conditions for the existence of observers to guarantee the fault sensitivity and disturbance robustness in infinite frequency domain are presented. In order to further relax the conservativeness, slack matrices are introduced to fully decouple the observer gain with the Lyapunov matrices in finite frequency range. Iterative linear matrix inequality algorithms are proposed to obtain the solutions. The simulation examples which contain a Monte Carlo campaign illustrate that the new methods can effectively reduce the design conservativeness compared with the existing methods.

Artificial Neural Network Based Fault Diagnostics of Rotating Machinery Using Wavelet Transforms as a Preprocessor NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Paya, B. A.; Esat, I. I.; Badi, M. N. M. 1997-09-01 The purpose of condition monitoring and fault diagnostics are to detect and distinguish faults occurring in machinery, in order to provide a significant improvement in plant economy, reduce operational and maintenance costs and improve the level of safety. The condition of a model drive-line, consisting of various interconnected rotating parts, including an actual vehicle gearbox, two bearing housings, and an electric motor, all connected via flexible couplings and loaded by a disc brake, was investigated. This model drive-line was run in its normal condition, and then single and multiple faults were introduced intentionally to the gearbox, and to the one of the bearing housings. These single and multiple faults studied on the drive-line were typical bearing and gear faults which may develop during normal and continuous operation of this kind of rotating machinery. This paper presents the investigation carried out in order to study both bearing and gear faults introduced first separately as a single fault and then together as multiple faults to the drive-line. The real time domain vibration signals obtained for the drive-line were preprocessed by wavelet transforms for the neural network to perform fault detection and identify the exact kinds of fault occurring in the model drive-line. It is shown that by using multilayer artificial neural networks on the sets of preprocessed data by wavelet transforms, single and multiple faults were successfully detected and classified into distinct groups.

PMID:25760051 Acoustic Detection of Faults and Degradation in a High-Bypass Turbofan Engine during VIPR Phase III Testing NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Boyle, Devin K. 2017-01-01 The Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) Phase III project was executed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and several industry, academic, and government partners in the summer of 2015. One of the research objectives was to use external radial acoustic microphone arrays to detect changes in the noise characteristics produced by the research engine during volcanic ash ingestion and seeded fault insertion scenarios involving bleed air valves. Preliminary results indicate the successful acoustic detection of suspected degradation as a result of cumulative exposure to volcanic ash. This detection is shown through progressive changes, particularly in the high-frequency content, as a function of exposure to greater cumulative quantities of ash. Additionally, detection of the simulated failure of the 14th stage stability bleed valve and, to a lesser extent, the station 2.5 stability bleed valve, to their fully-open fail-safe positions was achieved by means of spectral comparisons between nominal (normal valve operation) and seeded fault scenarios. Detection of Motor Impairment in Parkinson's Disease Via Mobile Touchscreen Typing. Arroyo-Gallego, Teresa; Ledesma-Carbayo, Maria Jesus; Sanchez-Ferro, Alvaro; Butterworth, Ian; Mendoza, Carlos S; Matarazzo, Michele; Montero, Paloma; Lopez-Blanco, Roberto; Puertas-Martin, Veronica; Trincado, Rocio; Giancardo, Luca 2017-09-01 Mobile technology is opening a wide range of opportunities for transforming the standard of care for chronic disorders. Using smartphones as tools for longitudinally tracking symptoms could enable personalization of drug regimens and improve patient monitoring. Parkinson's disease (PD) is an ideal candidate for these tools. At present, evaluation of PD signs requires trained experts to quantify motor impairment in the clinic, limiting the frequency and quality of the information available for understanding the status and progression of the disease. Mobile technology can help clinical decision making by completing the information of motor status between hospital visits. This paper presents an algorithm to detect PD by analyzing the typing activity on smartphones independently of the content of the typed text. We propose a set of touchscreen typing features based on a covariance, skewness, and kurtosis analysis of the timing information of the data to capture PD motor signs. We tested these features, both independently and in a multivariate framework, in a population of 21 PD and 23 control subjects, achieving a sensitivity/specificity of 0.81/0.81 for the best performing feature and 0.73/0.84 for the best multivariate method. The results of the alternating finger-tapping, an established motor test, measured in our cohort are 0.75/0.78. This paper contributes to the development of a home-based, high-compliance, and high-frequency PD motor test by analysis of routine typing on touchscreens.

Detection and Classification of Motor Vehicle Noise in a Forested Landscape NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Brown, Casey L.; Reed, Sarah E.; Dietz, Matthew S.; Fristrup, Kurt M. 2013-11-01 Noise emanating from human activity has become a common addition to natural soundscapes and has the potential to harm wildlife and erode human enjoyment of nature. In particular, motor vehicles traveling along roads and trails produce high levels of both chronic and intermittent noise, eliciting varied responses from a wide range of animal species. Anthropogenic noise is especially conspicuous in natural areas where ambient background sound levels are low. In this article, we present an acoustic method to detect and analyze motor vehicle noise. Our approach uses inexpensive consumer products to record sound, sound analysis software to automatically detect sound events within continuous recordings and measure their acoustic properties, and statistical classification methods to categorize sound events. We describe an application of this approach to detect motor vehicle noise on paved, gravel, and natural-surface roads, and off-road vehicle trails in 36 sites distributed throughout a national forest in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA. These low-cost, unobtrusive methods can be used by scientists and managers to detect anthropogenic noise events for many potential applications, including ecological research, transportation and recreation planning, and natural resource management.

Detection of inter-turn faults in transformer winding using the capacitor discharge method NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Michna, Michał; Wilk, Andrzej; Ziółko, Michał; Wołoszyk, Marek; Swędrowski, Leon; Szwangruber, Piotr 2017-12-01 The paper presents results of an analysis of inter-turn fault effects on the voltage and current waveforms of a capacitor discharge through transformer windings. The research was conducted in the frame of the Facility of Antiproton and Ion Research project which goal is to build a new international accelerator facility that utilizes superconducting magnets. For the sake of electrical quality assurance of the superconducting magnet circuits, a measurement and diagnostic system is currently under development at Gdansk University of Technology (GUT). Appropriate measurements and simulations of the special transformer system were performed to verify the proposed diagnostic method. In order to take into account the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the magnetic yoke, a novel mathematical model of the transformer was developed. A special test bench was constructed to emulate the inter-turn faults within transformer windings. Fault detection technique for wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network using chaotic fiber laser NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Xu, Naijun; Yang, Lingzhen; Zhang, Juan; Zhang, Xiangyuan; Wang, Juanfen; Zhang, Zhaoxia; Liu, Xianglian 2014-03-01 We propose a fault localization method for wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON). A proof-of-concept experiment was demonstrated by utilizing the wavelength tunable chaotic laser generated from an erbium-doped fiber ring laser with a manual tunable fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) filter. The range of the chaotic lasing wavelength can cover the C-band. Basing on the TFBG filter, we can adjust the wavelength of the chaotic laser to match the WDM-PON channel with identical wavelength. We determined the fault location by calculating the cross-correlation between the reference and return signals. Analysis of the characteristics of the wavelength tunable chaotic laser showed that the breakpoint, the loose connector, and the mismatch connector could be precisely located. A dynamic range of approximately 23.8 dB and a spatial resolution of 4 cm, which was independent of the measuring range, were obtained.

Natural roller bearing fault detection by angular measurement of true instantaneous angular speed NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Renaudin, L.; Bonnardot, F.; Musy, O.; Doray, J. B.; Rémond, D. 2010-10-01 The challenge in many production activities involving large mechanical devices like power transmissions consists in reducing the machine downtime, in managing repairs and in improving operating time. Most online monitoring systems are based on conventional vibration measurement devices for gear transmissions or bearings in mechanical components. In this paper, we propose an alternative way of bearing condition monitoring based on the instantaneous angular speed measurement. By the help of a large experimental investigation on two different applications, we prove that localized faults like pitting in bearing generate small angular speed fluctuations which are measurable with optical or magnetic encoders. We also emphasize the benefits of measuring instantaneous angular speed with the pulse timing method through an implicit angular sampling which ensures insensitivity to speed fluctuation. A wide range of operating conditions have been tested for the two applications with varying speed, load, external excitations, gear ratio, etc. The tests performed on an automotive gearbox or on actual operating vehicle wheels also establish the robustness of the proposed methodology. By the means of a conventional Fourier transform, angular frequency channels kinematically related to the fault periodicity show significant magnitude differences related to the damage severity. Sideband effects are evidently seen when the fault is located on rotating parts of the bearing due to load modulation. Additionally, slip effects are also suspected to be at the origin of enlargement of spectrum peaks in the case of double row bearings loaded in a pure radial direction..

PMID:29354084 A novel micro-Raman technique to detect and characterize 4H-SiC stacking faults Piluso, N., E-mail: nicolo.piluso[USER].cnr.it; Camarda, M.; La Via, F.}), creating an electronic plasma that couples with the longitudinal optical (LO) Raman mode. The Raman shift of the LO phonon-plasmon-coupled mode (LOPC) increases as the free carrier density increases. Crystallographic defects lead to scattering or recombination of the free carriers which results in a loss of coupling with the LOPC, and in a reduction of the Raman shift. Given that the LOmore » phonon-plasmon coupling is obtained thanks to the free carriers generated by the high injection level induced by the laser, we named this technique induced-LOPC (i-LOPC). This technique allows the simultaneous determination of both the carrier lifetime and carrier mobility. Taking advantage of the modifications on the carrier lifetime induced by extended defects, we were able to determine the spatial morphology of stacking faults; the obtained morphologies were found to be in excellent agreement with those provided by standard photoluminescence techniques. The results show that the detection of defects via i-LOPC spectroscopy is totally independent from the stacking fault photoluminescence signals that cover a large energy range up to 0.7 eV, thus allowing for a single-scan simultaneous determination of any kind of stacking fault. Combining the i-LOPC method with the analysis of the transverse optical mode, the micro-Raman characterization can determine the most important properties of unintentionally doped film, including the stress status of the wafer, lattice impurities (point defects, polytype inclusions) and a detailed analysis of crystallographic defects, with a high spectral and spatial resolution.« less Fractal dimension and fuzzy logic systems for broken rotor bar detection in induction motors at start-up and steady-state regimes NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Amezquita-Sanchez, Juan P.; Valtierra-Rodriguez, Martin; Perez-Ramirez, Carlos A.; Camarena-Martinez, David; Garcia-Perez, Arturo; Romero-Troncoso, Rene J. 2017-07-01 Squirrel-cage induction motors (SCIMs) are key machines in many industrial applications. In this regard, the monitoring of their operating condition aiming at avoiding damage and reducing economical losses has become a demanding task for industry. In the literature, several techniques and methodologies to detect faults that affect the integrity and performance of SCIMs have been proposed. However, they have only been focused on analyzing either the start-up transient or the steady-state operation regimes, two common operating scenarios in real practice. In this work, a novel methodology for broken rotor bar (BRB) detection in SCIMs during both start-up and steady-state operation regimes is proposed. It consists of two main steps. In the first one, the analysis of three-axis vibration signals using fractal dimension (FD) theory is carried out. Since different FD-based algorithms can give different results, three algorithms named Katz’ FD, Higuchi’s FD, and box dimension, are tested. In the second step, a fuzzy logic system for each regime is presented for automatic diagnosis. To validate the proposal, a motor with different damage levels has been tested: one with a partially BRB, a second with one fully BRB, and the third with two BRBs. The obtained results demonstrate the proposed effectiveness. 3D seismic detection of shallow faults and fluid migration pathways offshore Southern Costa Rica: Application of neural-network meta-attributes NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Kluesner, J. W.; Silver, E. A.; Nale, S. M.; Bangs, N. L.; McIntosh, K. D. 2013-12-01 We employ a seismic meta-attribute workflow to detect and analyze probable faults and fluid-pathways in 3D within the sedimentary section offshore Southern Costa Rica. During the CRISP seismic survey in 2011 we collected an 11 x 55 km grid of 3D seismic reflection data and high-resolvability EM122 multibeam data, with coverage extending from the incoming plate to the outer-shelf. We mapped numerous seafloor seep indicators, with distributions ranging from the lower-slope to ~15 km landward of the shelf break [Kluesner et al., 2013, G3, doi:10.1002/ggge.20058; Silver et al., this meeting]. We used the OpendTect software package to calculate meta-attribute volumes from the 3D seismic data in order to detect and visualize seismic discontinuities in 3D. This methodology consists of dip-steered filtering to pre-condition the data, followed by combining a set of advanced dip-steered seismic attributes into a single object probability attribute using a user-trained neural-network pattern-recognition algorithm. The parameters of the advanced seismic attributes are set for optimal detection of the desired geologic discontinuity (e.g. faults or fluid-pathways). The product is a measure of probability for the desired target that ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest probability. Within the sedimentary section of the CRISP survey the results indicate focused fluid-migration pathways along dense networks of intersecting normal faults with approximately N-S and E-W trends. This pattern extends from the middle slope to the outer-shelf region. Dense clusters of fluid-migration pathways are located above basement highs and deeply rooted reverse faults [see Bangs et al., this meeting], including a dense zone of fluid-pathways imaged below IODP Site U1413. In addition, fault intersections frequently show an increased signal of fluid-migration and these zones may act as major conduits for fluid-flow through the sedimentary cover.

Additionally, the ratio of the 2nd and 4th digits of these children, which is thought to be an indicator of foetal testosterone, was measured. Children in the experimental group were impaired at tasks of motor control,… Sensor fault detection and isolation via high-gain observers: application to a double-pipe heat exchanger. Escobar, R F; Astorga-Zaragoza, C M; Téllez-Anguiano, A C; Juárez-Romero, D; Hernández, J A; Guerrero-Ramírez, G V 2011-07-01 This paper deals with fault detection and isolation (FDI) in sensors applied to a concentric-pipe counter-flow heat exchanger. The proposed FDI is based on the analytical redundancy implementing nonlinear high-gain observers which are used to generate residuals when a sensor fault is presented (as software sensors). By evaluating the generated residual, it is possible to switch between the sensor and the observer when a failure is detected. Experiments in a heat exchanger pilot validate the effectiveness of the approach. The FDI technique is easy to implement allowing the industries to have an excellent alternative tool to keep their heat transfer process under supervision. The main contribution of this work is based on a dynamic model with heat transfer coefficients which depend on temperature and flow used to estimate the output temperatures of a heat exchanger. This model provides a satisfactory approximation of the states of the heat exchanger in order to allow its implementation in a FDI system used to perform supervision tasks. Copyright © 2011 ISA.

Spatial-Temporal Synchrophasor Data Characterization and Analytics in Smart Grid Fault Detection, Identification, and Impact Causal Analysis Jiang, Huaiguang; Dai, Xiaoxiao; Gao, David Wenzhong An approach of big data characterization for smart grids (SGs) and its applications in fault detection, identification, and causal impact analysis is proposed in this paper, which aims to provide substantial data volume reduction while keeping comprehensive information from synchrophasor measurements in spatial and temporal domains. Especially, based on secondary voltage control (SVC) and local SG observation algorithm, a two-layer dynamic optimal synchrophasor measurement devices selection algorithm (OSMDSA) is proposed to determine SVC zones, their corresponding pilot buses, and the optimal synchrophasor measurement devices. Combining the two-layer dynamic OSMDSA and matching pursuit decomposition, the synchrophasor data is completely characterized inmore » the spatial-temporal domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed characterization approach, SG situational awareness is investigated based on hidden Markov model based fault detection and identification using the spatial-temporal characteristics generated from the reduced data. To identify the major impact buses, the weighted Granger causality for SGs is proposed to investigate the causal relationship of buses during system disturbance. The IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system are employed to validate and evaluate the proposed approach.« less Fault detection of the connection of lithium-ion power batteries based on entropy for electric vehicles NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yao, Lei; Wang, Zhenpo; Ma, Jun 2015-10-01 This paper proposes a method of fault detection of the connection of Lithium-Ion batteries based on entropy for electric vehicle. In electric vehicle operation process, some factors, such as road conditions, driving habits, vehicle performance, always affect batteries by vibration, which easily cause loosing or virtual connection between batteries. Through the simulation of the battery charging and discharging experiment under vibration environment, the data of voltage fluctuation can be obtained. Meanwhile, an optimal filtering method is adopted using discrete cosine filter method to analyze the characteristics of system noise, based on the voltage set when batteries are working under different vibration frequency. Experimental data processed by filtering is analyzed based on local Shannon entropy, ensemble Shannon entropy and sample entropy. And the best way to find a method of fault detection of the connection of lithium-ion batteries based on entropy is presented for electric vehicle. The experimental data shows that ensemble Shannon entropy can predict the accurate time and the location of battery connection failure in real time. Besides electric-vehicle industry, this method can also be used in other areas in complex vibration environment. Fault detection and isolation in GPS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring based on chaos particle swarm optimization-particle filter algorithm NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Ershen; Jia, Chaoying; Tong, Gang; Qu, Pingping; Lan, Xiaoyu; Pang, Tao 2018-03-01 The receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is one of the most important parts in an avionic navigation system. Two problems need to be addressed to improve this system, namely, the degeneracy phenomenon and lack of samples for the standard particle filter (PF). However, the number of samples cannot adequately express the real distribution of the probability density function (i.e., sample impoverishment). This study presents a GPS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method based on a chaos particle swarm optimization particle filter (CPSO-PF) algorithm with a log likelihood ratio. The chaos sequence generates a set of chaotic variables, which are mapped to the interval of optimization variables to improve particle quality. This chaos perturbation overcomes the potential for the search to become trapped in a local optimum in the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Test statistics are configured based on a likelihood ratio, and satellite fault detection is then conducted by checking the consistency between the state estimate of the main PF and those of the auxiliary PFs. Based on GPS data, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect and isolate satellite faults under conditions of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Moreover, the performance of the proposed novel method is better than that of RAIM based on the PF or PSO-PF algorithm... A New Approach to Detect Mover Position in Linear Motors Using Magnetic Sensors Paul, Sarbajit; Chang, Junghwan 2015-01-01 A new method to detect the mover position of a linear motor is proposed in this paper. This method employs a simple cheap Hall Effect sensor-based magnetic sensor unit to detect the mover position of the linear motor. With the movement of the linear motor, Hall Effect sensor modules electrically separated 120° along with the idea of three phase balanced condition (va + vb + vc = 0) are used to produce three phase signals. The amplitude of the sensor output voltage signals are adjusted to unit amplitude to minimize the amplitude errors. With the unit amplitude signals three to two phase transformation is done to reduce the three multiples of harmonic components. The final output thus obtained is converted to position data by the use of arctangent function. The measurement accuracy of the new method is analyzed by experiments and compared with the conventional two phase method. Using the same number of sensor modules as the conventional two phase method, the proposed method gives more accurate position information compared to the conventional system where sensors are separated by 90° electrical angles.

Zhang, Zhi-Hui; Yang, Guang-Hong 2017-05-01 This paper provides a novel event-triggered fault detection (FD) scheme for discrete-time linear systems. First, an event-triggered interval observer is proposed to generate the upper and lower residuals by taking into account the influence of the disturbances and the event error. Second, the robustness of the residual interval against the disturbances and the fault sensitivity are improved by introducing l 1 and H ∞ performances. Third, dilated linear matrix inequalities are used to decouple the Lyapunov matrices from the system matrices. The nonnegative conditions for the estimation error variables are presented with the aid of the slack matrix variables. This technique allows considering a more general Lyapunov function. Furthermore, the FD decision scheme is proposed by monitoring whether the zero value belongs to the residual interval. It is shown that the information communication burden is reduced by designing the event-triggering mechanism, while the FD performance can still be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Copyright © 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. A joint resonance frequency estimation and in-band noise reduction method for enhancing the detectability of bearing fault signals NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bozchalooi, I. Soltani; Liang, Ming 2008-05-01 The vibration signal measured from a bearing contains vital information for the prognostic and health assessment purposes. However, when bearings are installed as part of a complex mechanical system, the measured signal is often heavily clouded by various noises due to the compounded effect of interferences of other machine elements and background noises present in the measuring device. As such, reliable condition monitoring would not be possible without proper de-noising. This is particularly true for incipient bearing faults with very weak signature signals. A new de-noising scheme is proposed in this paper to enhance the vibration signals acquired from faulty bearings. This de-noising scheme features a spectral subtraction to trim down the in-band noise prior to wavelet filtering. The Gabor wavelet is used in the wavelet transform and its parameters, i.e., scale and shape factor are selected in separate steps. The proper scale is found based on a novel resonance estimation algorithm. This algorithm makes use of the information derived from the variable shaft rotational speed though such variation is highly undesirable in fault detection since it complicates the process substantially. The shape factor value is then selected by minimizing a smoothness index. This index is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the wavelet coefficient moduli. De-noising results are presented for simulated signals and experimental data acquired from both normal and faulty bearings with defective outer race, inner race, and rolling element. Robust sensor fault detection and isolation of gas turbine engines subjected to time-varying parameter uncertainties NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Pourbabaee, Bahareh; Meskin, Nader; Khorasani, Khashayar 2016-08-01 In this paper, a novel robust sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) strategy using the multiple model-based (MM) approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise in all the channels. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for multiple piecewise linear (PWL) models that are constructed at various operating points of an uncertain nonlinear system. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility conditions. The proposed multiple RKF-based FDI scheme is simulated for a single spool gas turbine engine to diagnose various sensor faults despite the presence of parameter uncertainties, process and measurement noise. Our comparative studies confirm the superiority of our proposed FDI method when compared to the methods that are available in the literature. A Wearable Channel Selection-Based Brain-Computer Interface for Motor Imagery Detection. Lo, Chi-Chun; Chien, Tsung-Yi; Chen, Yu-Chun; Tsai, Shang-Ho; Fang, Wai-Chi; Lin, Bor-Shyh 2016-02-06 Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication interface between an external machine and the brain. Many kinds of spatial filters are used in BCIs to enhance the electroencephalography (EEG) features related to motor imagery. The approach of channel selection, developed to reserve meaningful EEG channels, is also an important technique for the development of BCIs. However, current BCI systems require a conventional EEG machine and EEG electrodes with conductive gel to acquire multi-channel EEG signals and then transmit these EEG signals to the back-end computer to perform the approach of channel selection. This reduces the convenience of use in daily life and increases the limitations of BCI applications. In order to improve the above issues, a novel wearable channel selection-based brain-computer interface is proposed. Here, retractable comb-shaped active dry electrodes are designed to measure the EEG signals on a hairy site, without conductive gel. By the design of analog CAR spatial filters and the firmware of EEG acquisition module, the function of spatial filters could be performed without any calculation, and channel selection could be performed in the front-end device to improve the practicability of detecting motor imagery in the wearable EEG device directly or in commercial mobile phones or tablets, which may have relatively low system specifications. Finally, the performance of the proposed BCI is investigated, and the experimental results show that the proposed system is a good wearable BCI system prototype. themore » reactive and schedule-based preventive maintenance commonly used today, when maintenance of RTUs is done at all. Improved maintenance would help ensure persistent peak operating efficiencies, reducing energy consumption by an estimated 10% to 30%.« less Evaluate the application of modal test and analysis processes to structural fault detection in MSFC - STS project elements NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Springer, William T. 1987-01-01 The Space Transportation System (STS) is a complex and expensive flight system intended to carry unique payloads into low Earth orbit and return. A catastrophic failure, such as STS 51-L, resulted in the loss of both human life as well as expensive and unique hardware. The impact of this incident reaffirms the need to do everything possible to ensure the integrity and reliability of STS. One means of achieving this goal is to expand the number of inspection technologies available. Reported here is the evaluation of the use of modal analysis and test techniques for the purpose of assessing the structural integrity of STS components for which Marshall Space Flight Center has responsibility. This entailed reviewing existing literature and developing a low-level experimental program determine the feasibility of using this technology for structural fault detection. High-rate real-time GPS network at Parkfield: Utility for detecting fault slip and seismic displacements USGS Publications Warehouse Langbein, J.; Bock, Y. 2004-01-01 A. Comparison of Fault Detection Algorithms for Real-time Diagnosis in Large-Scale System. Appendix E NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Kirubarajan, Thiagalingam; Malepati, Venkat; Deb, Somnath; Ying, Jie 2001-01-01 In this paper, we present a review of different real-time capable algorithms to detect and isolate component failures in large-scale systems in the presence of inaccurate test results. A sequence of imperfect test results (as a row vector of I's and O's) are available to the algorithms. In this case, the problem is to recover the uncorrupted test result vector and match it to one of the rows in the test dictionary, which in turn will isolate the faults. In order to recover the uncorrupted test result vector, one needs the accuracy of each test. That is, its detection and false alarm probabilities are required. In this problem, their true values are not known and, therefore, have to be estimated online. Other major aspects in this problem are the large-scale nature and the real-time capability requirement. Test dictionaries of sizes up to 1000 x 1000 are to be handled. That is, results from 1000 tests measuring the state of 1000 components are available. However, at any time, only 10-20% of the test results are available. Then, the objective becomes the real-time fault diagnosis using incomplete and inaccurate test results with online estimation of test accuracies. It should also be noted that the test accuracies can vary with time --- one needs a mechanism to update them after processing each test result vector. Using Qualtech's TEAMS-RT (system simulation and real-time diagnosis tool), we test the performances of 1) TEAMSAT's built-in diagnosis algorithm, 2) Hamming distance based diagnosis, 3) Maximum Likelihood based diagnosis, and 4) HidderMarkov Model based diagnosis.. Low power test architecture for dynamic read destructive fault detection in SRAM NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Takher, Vikram Singh; Choudhary, Rahul Raj 2018-06-01 Dynamic Read Destructive Fault (dRDF) is the outcome of resistive open defects in the core cells of static random-access memories (SRAMs). The sensitisation of dRDF involves either performing multiple read operations or creation of number of read equivalent stress (RES), on the core cell under test. Though the creation of RES is preferred over the performing multiple read operation on the core cell, cell dissipates more power during RES than during the read or write operation. This paper focuses on the reduction in power dissipation by optimisation of number of RESs, which are required to sensitise the dRDF during test mode of operation of SRAM. The novel pre-charge architecture has been proposed in order to reduce the power dissipation by limiting the number of RESs to an optimised number of two. The proposed low power architecture is simulated and analysed which shows reduction in power dissipation by reducing the number of RESs up to 18.18%.

Detection of small earthquakes with dense array data: example from the San Jacinto fault zone, southern California NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Meng, Haoran; Ben-Zion, Yehuda 2018-01-01 We present a technique to detect small earthquakes not included in standard catalogues using data from a dense seismic array. The technique is illustrated with continuous waveforms recorded in a test day by 1108 vertical geophones in a tight array on the San Jacinto fault zone. Waveforms are first stacked without time-shift in nine non-overlapping subarrays to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The nine envelope functions of the stacked records are then multiplied with each other to suppress signals associated with sources affecting only some of the nine subarrays. Running a short-term moving average/long-term moving average (STA/LTA) detection algorithm on the product leads to 723 triggers in the test day. Using a local P-wave velocity model derived for the surface layer from Betsy gunshot data, 5 s long waveforms of all sensors around each STA/LTA trigger are beamformed for various incident directions. Of the 723 triggers, 220 are found to have localized energy sources and 103 of these are confirmed as earthquakes by verifying their observation at 4 or more stations of the regional seismic network. This demonstrates the general validity of the method and allows processing further the validated events using standard techniques. The number of validated events in the test day is &gt;5 times larger than that in the standard catalogue. Using these events as templates can lead to additional detections of many more earthquakes..

Wiegand, Thomas; Liao, Wei-Chih; Ong, Ta Chung; Däpp, Alexander; Cadalbert, Riccardo; Copéret, Christophe; Böckmann, Anja; Meier, Beat H 2017-11-01 DNP (dynamic nuclear polarization)-enhanced solid-state NMR is employed to directly detect protein-DNA and protein-ATP interactions and identify the residue type establishing the intermolecular contacts. While conventional solid-state NMR can detect protein-DNA interactions in large oligomeric protein assemblies in favorable cases, it typically suffers from low signal-to-noise ratios. We show here, for the oligomeric DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with ADP and single-stranded DNA, that this limitation can be overcome by using DNP-enhanced spectroscopy. Interactions are established by DNP-enhanced 31 P- 13 C polarization-transfer experiments followed by the recording of a 2D 13 C- 13 C correlation experiment. The NMR spectra were obtained in less than 2 days and allowed the identification of residues of the motor protein involved in nucleotide binding.

Application of a Subspace-Based Fault Detection Method to Industrial Structures NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mevel, L.; Hermans, L.; van der Auweraer, H. 1999-11-01 Early detection and localization of damage allow increased expectations of reliability, safety and reduction of the maintenance cost. This paper deals with the industrial validation of a technique to monitor the health of a structure in operating conditions (e.g. rotating machinery, civil constructions subject to ambient excitations, etc.) and to detect slight deviations in a modal model derived from in-operation measured data. In this paper, a statistical local approach based on covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification is proposed. The capabilities and limitations of the method with respect to health monitoring and damage detection are discussed and it is explained how the method can be practically used in industrial environments. After the successful validation of the proposed method on a few laboratory structures, its application to a sports car is discussed. The example illustrates that the method allows the early detection of a vibration-induced fatigue problem of a sports car. In-situ fault detection apparatus and method for an encased energy storing device Hagen, Ronald A.; Comte, Christophe; Knudson, Orlin B.; Rosenthal, Brian; Rouillard, Jean 2000-01-01 An apparatus and method for detecting a breach in an electrically insulating surface of an electrically conductive power system enclosure within which a number of series connected energy storing devices are disposed. The energy storing devices disposed in the enclosure are connected to a series power connection. A detector is coupled to the series connection and detects a change of state in a test signal derived from the series connected energy storing devices. The detector detects a breach in the insulating layer of the enclosure by detecting a state change in the test signal from a nominal state to a non-nominal state. A voltage detector detects a state change of the test signals from a nominal state, represented by a voltage of a selected end energy storing device, to a non-nominal state, represented by a voltage that substantially exceeds the voltage of the selected opposing end energy storing device. Alternatively, the detector may comprise a signal generator that produces the test signal as a time-varying or modulated test signal and injects the test signal into the series connection. The detector detects the state change of the time-varying or modulated test signal from a nominal state, represented by a signal substantially equivalent to the test signal, to a non-nominal state, representative by an absence of the test signal. Detection and Classification of Transformer Winding Mechanical Faults Using UWB Sensors and Bayesian Classifier NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Alehosseini, Ali; A. Hejazi, Maryam; Mokhtari, Ghassem; B. Gharehpetian, Gevork; Mohammadi, Mohammad 2015-06-01 In this paper, the Bayesian classifier is used to detect and classify the radial deformation and axial displacement of transformer windings. The proposed method is tested on a model of transformer for different volumes of radial deformation and axial displacement. In this method, ultra-wideband (UWB) signal is sent to the simplified model of the transformer winding. The received signal from the winding model is recorded and used for training and testing of Bayesian classifier in different axial displacement and radial deformation states of the winding. It is shown that the proposed method has a good accuracy to detect and classify the axial displacement and radial deformation of the winding. Detecting Blind Fault with Fractal and Roughness Factors from High Resolution LiDAR DEM at Taiwan NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cheng, Y. S.; Yu, T. T. 2014-12-01 There is no obvious fault scarp associated with blind fault. The traditional method of mapping this unrevealed geological structure is the cluster of seismicity. Neither the seismic event nor the completeness of cluster could be captured by network to chart the location of the entire possible active blind fault within short period of time. High resolution DEM gathered by LiDAR could denote actual terrain information despite the existence of plantation. 1-meter interval DEM of mountain region at Taiwan is utilized by fractal, entropy and roughness calculating with MATLAB code. By jointing these handing, the regions of non-sediment deposit are charted automatically. Possible blind fault associated with Chia-Sen earthquake at southern Taiwan is served as testing ground. GIS layer help in removing the difference from various geological formation, then multi-resolution fractal index is computed around the target region. The type of fault movement controls distribution of fractal index number. The scale of blind fault governs degree of change in fractal index. Landslide induced by rainfall and/or earthquake possesses larger degree of geomorphology alteration than blind fault; special treatment in removing these phenomena is required. Highly weathered condition at Taiwan should erase the possible trace remained upon DEM from the ru</td>\n",

       "      <td>Grant Morrison, earlier this year Pádraig’s articles perhaps suggests there is a demand for such information however, and many of the comments certainly demonstrate a lack of adequate knowledge of the facts. Now who could possibly shine a light on this topic…? Ah, hang on, I know just the fella. Behold then, a remix edition of Alan Moore and Superfolks Part 3: The Strange Case of Grant Morrison and Alan Moore, where we cut and splice the original article – with Pádraig’s blessing I hasten to add! – with Grant Morrison’s own voice. Some bright hard fact-saliva, as one man would put it, and it is sorely needed. Whatever your stance on Moore, Morrison-bashing is rather rife, and quite unfair when you are aware of both sides of the story. As to my own credentials, I have interviewed both men more than once in the past, and enjoy many of the works of both, but have had very different experiences with the two men on both a personal and professional level. I freely admit then my bias towards Morrison, as Pádraig does for Moore. But enough of me, let’s get on with the remix. All Grant’s words are in red font for ease of reading: Hope the following rather massive info-dump helps clarify a few things. I also hope this may explain why I’ve sometimes felt myself to be the victim of a genuine grudge that seems quite staggering in its sincerity and longevity. Reading the comments section following “The Strange Case of Alan Moore and Grant Morrison” I can’t help but note how heavily my detractors rely on a total lack of research, gross distortions of historical fact, and playground name-calling to support their alleged points. Not that I expect this to make much difference but the opportunity to separate fact from fantasy is a welcome one. Pádraig quotes from Alan Moore discussing me during a webchat earlier this year without challenging even the most obvious and basic of the many historical inaccuracies and contradictions in Moore’s assertions. In fact, Moore’s recollections are completely unreliable and I wouldn’t mind having some facts put on record, once and for all. Thanks to Pádraig for allowing me to respond directly to his piece and to Laura for bringing it to my attention and offering me space on The Beat to get some things off my medal-heavy chest. Originally, when I set out to look into the various allegations about Alan Moore and Robert Mayer’s Superfolks, I thought it was going to be a comparatively straightforward piece to write. Just read the book, find out what people had said, and attempt to match the two of them up together. What could be easier, I asked myself? Ten thousand words and nearly a year later, I find that I could not have been more wrong. However, doing the research is at least half the fun, I’ve always said. Much of the fascination of writing about things like this is that you never know what you’re going to find out. And one of the things that I found out was that I really needed to know more about the animosity between Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, as it seemed to be a constantly recurring aspect of the story of Moore and Superfolks. So, to go back to where I started, back to the beginning of the piece called Alan Moore and Superfolks: Part 1 – The Case for the Prosecution, there’s that piece from Grant Morrison’s Drivel column in Speakeasy (July 1990), where he talks about reading Superfolks, and makes it really quite clear that he thinks – or pretends to think – that Alan Moore plundered the book for ideas. But this isn’t by any means the beginning of their – for want of a better word – relationship. But what is the beginning of that relationship? There are two different versions of this, depending on who you listen to. Not entirely. One “version” is supported by incontrovertible facts and verifiable research. The other relies on demonstrable errors. Beginning with the latter - So, first there’s Alan Moore’s version of events, which I’ve transcribed from the webchat he did for the Harvey Pekar statue Kickstarter. One of the questioners asked, You are somewhat surprisingly not the only acclaimed comics writer from the UK to also be a vocal magician. Obviously I’m talking about Grant Morrison here, who has never been terribly shy about his views on you or your work. Can we possibly draw you out on your views of him and his work? To which Moore replied, Well, let me see… The reason I haven’t spoken about Grant Morrison generally is because I’m not very interested in him, and I don’t really want to get involved with a writer of his calibre in some sort of squabble. But, for the record, since you asked: the first time I met him, he was an aspiring comics writer from Glasgow, I was up there doing a signing or something. They asked if I could perhaps – if they could invite a local comics writer who was a big admirer of mine along to the dinner. So I said yeah. This was I think the only time that I met him to speak to. He said how much he admired my work, how it had inspired him to want to be a comics writer. And I wished him the best of luck, I told him I’d look out for his work. When I saw that work in 2000 AD I thought ‘Well, this seems as if it’s a bit of a cross between Captain Britain and Marvelman, but that’s probably something that he’ll grow out of.’ - Let’s start with “an aspiring writer…” The usually well-informed Moore’s grasp of the facts is a little shaky here but the truth is well documented and, as can be quickly verified, my first professionally published comic book work “Time Is A Four-Letter Word” appeared in the independent adult sci-fi comic “Near Myths” in October 1978 (written and drawn by me, the story was/is, amusingly enough, based around the simultaneity of time concept Alan Moore himself is so fond of these days and which informs his in-progress novel “Jerusalem”). By 1979, I was also contributing stories on a regular basis to DC Thomson’s ‘Starblazer’ series and I’d begun a three year stint writing and drawing ‘Captain Clyde’, a weekly half-page newspaper strip about a lo-fi “realistic” Glasgow superhero. “Captain Clyde” ran in three newspapers. I was even a guest on panels at comics conventions. In October 1978, Alan Moore had sold one illustration – a drawing of Elvis Costello to NME – and had not yet achieved any recognition in the comics business. In 1979, he was doing unpaid humour cartoons for the underground paper “The Back Street Bugle”. I didn’t read his name in a byline until 1982, by which time I’d been a professional writer for almost five years. Using the miracle of computer technology, you can verify any of these dates right now, if you choose to. It’s true that Moore’s work in “Warrior” and “The Daredevils”, combined with the rising excitement of the early ’80s comics boom in Britain, galvanized me into refocusing and taking my existing comics career more seriously at a time (1982) when the music career I’d tried to pursue was spinning in circles but I hope even the most devoted of his readers might understand why I’ve grown tired of the widely-accepted, continually-reinforced belief that Moore’s work either predated my own or that he inspired or encouraged me to enter the comics field when it’s hardly a chore to fact-check the relevant publication dates. So I’ll repeat until maybe one day it sticks; I was already a professional writer/artist in the late ’70s, doing work-for-hire at DC Thomson alongside “creator-owned” sci-fi and superhero comics. This was at the same time as people like Bryan Talbot, Peter Milligan, Brendan McCarthy, and Brett Ewins, making us some of the earliest exemplars of the British new wave. If Alan Moore had never come along, if he’d given up halfway through his ground-breaking turn on “St. Pancras Panda”, we would all still have written and drawn our comics. We published our own fanzines, and small press outlets were popping up everywhere. “2000 AD” was at a peak. Marvel UK was in a period of expansion and innovation.. - It was on that basis that I recommended him to Karen Berger when she was starting [indecipherable speech – Vertigo?]. - It’s hard not to be a little insulted by Moore’s comments that he recommended me to Karen Berger for, what he has described on more than one occasion, and with a fairly extravagant degree of solipsistic self-regard, as a “proposed Alan Moore farm with Vertigo Comics”, seemingly unable to imagine veteran writers like Peter Milligan, me and others as anything more than extensions of his own self-image. See here- - or here - However, as five minutes research will confirm, the Vertigo imprint was established in 1993, by which time Alan Moore had fallen out with DC over the “For Mature Readers” ratings system and quit doing new work for them (I believe his split with DC occurred in 1987). I had already been working there for six years doing “Animal Man”, “Doom Patrol”, “Arkham Asylum”, “Gothic”, “Hellblazer” and “Kid Eternity”. I had a good relationship with Karen Berger and was a fairly obvious choice for her to call when she conceived the Vertigo imprint. No other recommendation was necessary. It ought to go without saying that none of us were told to write like Alan Moore – nor did we – and that this is an out-and-out lie. Far more significantly, much of the material that fed into early Vertigo was originated by the creators and by Editor Art Young for the proposed Touchmark imprint of creator-owned adult comics he’d been assigned to put together under the aegis of Disney, of all things. Coincidentally gay-themed series like Peter Milligan’s “Enigma” and my own “Sebastian 0″ – which actually grew out of a pitch for a revamp of IPC’s “Janus Stark” character – were commissioned by Art for publication at Touchmark, not by Karen Berger. When Touchmark experienced a failure to launch, Art was re-hired by DC and brought his portfolio of projects to Vertigo. At no point was Alan Moore involved in any of this. Again, why the fibs, other than to reinforce once more the fantasy of me – and indeed every other Vertigo writer – in a junior or subordinate position to himself? As Moore points out, the work I did on “Zenith” 25 years ago can trace a little – not all – of its influence to “Marvelman” and “Captain Britain” both of which I loved; my own introduction to the first volume of “Zenith”, published in 1988, admits as much, while also listing the book’s many other touchstones. - Then there started a kind of, a strange campaign of things in fanzines where he was expressing his opinions of me, as you put it. He later explained this as saying that when he started writing, he felt that he wasn’t famous enough, and that a good way of becoming famous would be to say nasty things about me. Which I suppose is a tactic – although not one that, of course, I’m likely to appreciate. So at that point I decided, after I’d seen a couple of his things and they seemed incredibly derivative, I just decided to stop bothering reading his work. And that’s largely sort of proven successful. But, there still seems to be this kind of [indecipherable speech] that I know. - I don’t believe I ever tried to get “famous” by insulting Alan Moore. It doesn’t seem the most likely route to celebrity. The commercial work I was doing in the early 1980s wasn’t much like the kind of material I wrote and drew for myself, or for indie publication.. I also did a good Chris Claremont and a semi-passable Douglas Adams. My personal work from the same time is written in a very different style, and is more in the vein of ‘Doom Patrol’ or ‘The Invisibles’. You don’t have to take my word for this: it can be verified by looking at the ‘Near Myths’ material or stuff like the “Famine” strip in “Food For Thought” from 1985. It can even be gleaned by looking at the clear difference between the first four “Animal Man” issues and the fifth – “The Coyote Gospel” story Pádraig mentions – and subsequent issues. Doing my own approximation of the “in” style to get gigs on Marvel UK books was, I thought, a demonstration of my range, versatility and adaptability to trends, not the declaration of some singular influence it has subsequently been distorted into over four decades – mostly by Alan Moore and his supporters, in what can sometimes feel like a never-ending campaign to undermine my personal achievements and successes and to cast me, at all times, in a subsidiary role to the Master. Furthermore to suggest, as Moore does, that subsequent work of mine, including the balance of “Animal Man”, “Doom Patrol”, “Flex Mentallo”, “JLA”, “The Invisibles”, “New X-Men”, “Seven Soldiers”, “Batman”, “All-Star Superman” etc. was equally indebted to “Captain Britain” and “Marvelman” means either one of two things: that he’s read the work in question and is again deliberately distorting the facts for reasons known only to himself – or that he hasn’t read it at all, in which case he’s in no position to comment surely? (I do know that Alan Moore has read a lot more of my work than he pretends to – one of his former collaborators quite innocently revealed as much to me a few years ago, confirming my own suspicions – but until Moore himself comes clean about it that will have to remain in the realm of hearsay.) - And, as far as I know, he’s the only bone of contention between me and Michael Moorcock. Michael Moorcock is a sweet sweet man – I believe he has only ever written one letter of complain to a publisher over the appropriation of his work, that was to DC Comics over Grant Morrison, so the only bone of contention between me and Michael Moorcock is which of us Grant Morrison is ripping off the most. I say that it’s Michael Moorcock, he says it’s me. We’ve nearly come to blows over it, but I’m reluctant to let it go that far, because, I’m probably more nimble than Moorcock – I’ve got a few years on him, I’m probably faster, but Moorcock is huge, he’s like a bear. He could just like take my arm off with one sweep of his paw, so we’ll let that go undecided for the moment. But, those are pretty much my thoughts on Grant Morrison, and hopefully now I’ve explained that I won’t have to mention his name again. Why would he feel qualified, on the basis of the “couple” of things of mine he claims to have read a long time ago, to insist that not only do I rip him off on a regular basis but his friend Michael Moorcock too? Can anyone tell me from which Michael Moorcock novels “Zenith” and “Animal Man” were plagiarized? (And if Moorcock made any complaints to DC in the ’90s, I never heard about them. I had no idea there was any beef with Moorcock until Pop Image’s Jonathan Ellis drew my attention to it in 2004). As an important aside in this discussion, Moorcock’s spurious allegations of creative theft are based on exactly TEN pages of material in issues 17-19 of “The Invisibles”. These pages were explicitly presented as a Moorcock pastiche – or more strictly a pastiche of my own Gideon Stargrave stories from “Near Myths”, which were heavily but not entirely influenced by Moorcock and J.G Ballard – occurring in the head of the fictional character King Mob. King Mob actually talks about his obsession with Jerry Cornelius within the story and I reference Moorcock’s work as an inspiration for these pages in the letters column of issue 17. Not content with deliberately misinterpreting a mere ten pages of my fifteen hundred page comic series, Moorcock – this “sweet, sweet man” – continues to this day to jeer and spit abuse. Here’s Alan Moore’s mate Michael Moorcock – - describing me as “a sticky-fingered tea leaf” (!) and talking about having me “duffed over”. “I’ve read the work of Grant Morrison twice. Once when I wrote it. Once when he wrote it. As far as I’m concerned my image of Grant Morrison is of someone wearing a mask, a flat hat and a striped jersey and carrying a bag marked SWAG.” Sexy! Leaving aside his own appropriation of entire swathes of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Harry Blyth, Moorcock fails to convince that he’s read any aspect of my “work” even once, let alone twice. He has so far failed to back up the casual slander with any actual evidence or examples of when he found the time to write “The Invisibles”, “St. Swithin’s Day”, “The New Adventures of Hitler”, “We3″, “The Filth”, “Kill Your Boyfriend”, “Mystery Play”, “Seaguy” or “Joe the Barbarian” to name just a few. In a 34-year career, I’ve also written long-running DC and Marvel series, plays, screenplays, video games, short stories and a book; all of which, if Michael Moorcock is to be believed, were written by him. Except for the bits I stole from Alan Moore! Allow me to demonstrate how easy it is to play this dangerous game: I’ll start by pointing out how various interviews in which I talked about my practice of Chaos Magic during the 1980s and early ’90s clearly played into Alan Moore’s decision to declare himself a magician in 1993. Next, with censorious authority, I’ll point to my own “Doom Patrol” and claim it gave him the idea for his “1963” project at Image, released a year later. I’ll suggest that Moore’s take on “Supreme” was a lot more like my take on “Animal Man” than “Zenith” was like “Marvelman” or “Captain Britain” – The Supremacy in “Supreme” is a fairly blatant copy of the Comic Book Limbo concept I introduced in “Animal Man” seven years earlier and the Moore book’s wider meta-fictional concerns also covered territory well-trodden by “Animal Man”. “LOEG: Century” with its apocalypse/moonchild plot occurring over three time periods cannot help but recall the apocalypse/moonchild plotline running over three time periods in “The Invisibles” fifteen years previously – with Orlando playing the Lord Fanny role, if you fancy. I could go on and on here, with “convincing” examples, but you get the idea. I’ll wind up with some condescending comment about how I figured he’d grow out of the rip-off magic and metafiction nonsense then wryly conclude that there’s not much chance of that now he’s nudging 60. The above is at least as plausible as Alan Moore’s outlandish attempts to claim that my entire career rests on two stories he wrote 30 years ago. As Ed Brubaker pointed out in the comments section of Part 2 of Pádraig’s series of articles, all writers are influenced by all kinds of things, including one another, all the time. The wider issues around plagiarism, influence, ownership and appropriation – especially in the context of the “IP”-driven corporate vision of creativity – are definitely worth further discussion but I’d like to keep this narrowed down to Pádraig’s essay and specifically Alan Moore’s comments about me. However, as evidence that I’m not alone before the jury, Moore has charged and found guilty the entire mainstream comics industry of living off his leftovers for 30 years here - - and in other interviews which relentlessly position his own oeuvre as the source of all our Niles. No-one would begrudge him his own obvious influences if he didn’t feel compelled to lecture the rest of us from a moral high ground he occupies dishonestly - Moore includes Geoff Johns among the “parasites” and “raccoons” rooting through his trash. Why? Because Johns seasoned his own epic expansion of the Green Lantern mythos with a couple of minor elements from Moore’s Green Lantern short story “Tygers” (1986) – a story that was itself created to make sense of a plot hole in the 1959 Green Lantern origin by Gardner Fox! So, in fact, both Moore and Johns were simply doing their work-for-hire jobs by adding to and expanding upon the many-authored quilt that is DC, and specifically Green Lantern, continuity. In a shared narrative universe, such as those of DC or Marvel, any element introduced into the continuity surely becomes part of the backstory and is therefore available to other writers to build upon or incorporate. Johns’ Green Lantern work and the “Blackest Night” story in particular would have worked as well without any reference to “Tygers”, in fact. Why the sneering, dehumanizing putdown? Who chastises a man for the unspeakable crime of synthesizing prior elements of Green Lantern’s back story into his own fresh and personal creative vision for the character, m’lud? Would Moore have appreciated a comparison to vermin snuffling among Gardner Fox’s garbage for treats when he brought Fox’s Floronic Man back from the archives to feature in a “Swamp Thing” (Len Wein’s trash!) story? What obsessive snouting around in the municipal tip does “League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” reduce to if we regard Alan Moore’s endeavours through the same unforgiving lens he applies to Geoff Johns’ work? Geoff Johns like the rest of us, has his own identifiable obsessions as a writer. He has his own interests, his own points of view, and his own way of articulating his ideas via his chosen medium. I know for a fact that Geoff has seen and done and endured things in his life that Alan Moore is unlikely ever to experience, yet Moore automatically brands him creatively bankrupt and tries to insists that Johns’ imagination is so low on fuel, it relies for sustenance on his own. If I can speak up for a friend, Geoff Johns, like the rest of us, like anyone who picks up a pen to earn a living, has plenty to say and, with all respect, he doesn’t need Alan Moore’s help to say it. Excuse the fit of editorializing there. It had to happen. Let’s return to the facts in this “Strange Case” - The other version of the story comes from Patrick Meaney’s Talking with Gods documentary, where Morrison says, I remember reading V for Vendetta and thinking, this is what I wanted to do, this is the way comics should be. One of the first things I did was go down to see Dez Skinn in London, the publisher of Warrior I had taking this story, which was a Kid Marvelman spec script, and he bought it straight away so, again, that was a really good jump for me. Then Alan Moore had it spiked, and said it was never to be published. Thus began our slight antagonism, which has persisted until this very day. They asked me to continue Marvelman because Moore had fallen out with everyone in the magazine, and taken away his script, and they said ‘Would you follow this up?’ And to me that was just like, oh my God – the idea of getting to do Marvelman, following Alan Moore, ‘I’m the only person in the world who’d really do this right,’ and I was well up for it. I didn’t want to do it without Moore’s permission, and I wrote to him and said, ‘They, ‘I don’t want this to sound like the softly hissed tones of a mafia hitman, but back off.’ And the letter was all, ‘but you can’t do this,’ you know, ‘we’re much more popular than you, and if you do this, your career will be over,’ and it was really quite threatening, you know, so I didn’t do it, but I ended up doing some little bit of work for Warrior. It’s hard to put exact dates on either of these versions, but presumably Moore’s story happened before Morrison’s, and, given that Morrison’s story refers to Moore having stopped writing Marvelman for Warrior this puts the date at some point between August 1984, when Moore’s last Marvelman story appeared, in Warrior , and February 1985, when Warrior , the last issue, came out, – containing the Morrison-scripted “The Liberators: Night Moves” incidentally. So the meeting in Glasgow between Moore and Morrison must have happened at some point between the first issue of Warrior in March 1982 and Moore’s last story, in August 1984. The exact timing in possibly not that important, but I like to nail these things down if I can! The timing is very important because Moore met me not once but many times – the first at a comic mart in Glasgow’s McLellan Galleries (in ’83, I think) when I gave him a copy of my music fanzine “Bombs Away Batman!” which contained positive reviews of his strips in “Warrior” and “2000AD”. The second time was at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow in 1984 where I recommended William McIllvaney’s “Laidlaw” novels to him. On both occasions, and whatever he may have thought then or now, I was not an ‘aspiring writer’ but a many times published one, as can easily be checked. In the company of Bryan Talbot, I spoke briefly with Moore again at a comic convention in Birmingham in 1986, by which time we had corresponded on the subject of “Marvelman”, and when we met for a fourth time at the dinner he semi-recalls (in Glasgow during the “Watchmen” Graphitti Editions tour in 1987, when he and Dave Gibbons signed a copy of their book for my mum), I was a full-time professional, working for “2000 AD” – and DC too by that point – not an aspiring writer (I also met and spoke with him after that – the last time we were in a room together was at the Angouleme comics festival in 1990 but by then he would no longer communicate with me, even by semaphore). When Moore says “They asked if I could perhaps – if they could invite a local comics writer who was a big admirer of mine along to the dinner.”, the careful, self-aggrandizing, phrasing suggests not only that Moore had no idea who I was but that some special privilege had been accorded me when, in fact, the meal was organized by John McShane, who ran AKA Books and Comics in Glasgow at the time. I spent two afternoons a week hanging around John’s shop talking comics, and as a friend and a fellow professional who knew Moore and respected his work, he naturally invited me along to the dinner as a guest. This mysterious “local comics writer” was, in fact, someone Alan Moore knew, had met, and had even exchanged letters with previously, as outlined above. A fellow professional, in fact. I remember talking to him about becoming a vegetarian – ‘sometimes you can’t live with the contradictions, Grant’… – which suggests I’d started work on “Animal Man”. I kept detailed diaries from 1978 – 93 and I can check the exact dates but “Arkham Asylum” was also written in 1987. I was far from up-and-coming at the point in time Moore cites.Why the made-up stories about me? Meanwhile, Morrison’s own star was on the rise. He started writing Zenith for 2000 AD in August 1987, after various other work here and there in UK comics, and this was his breakthrough work. I didn’t come across him myself until later on, when he was writing Animal Man for DC Comics, and still think that The Coyote Gospel from Animal Man is one of the single best things ever put on a page, by anyone. It was during this time that Morrison, as Moore put it, had ‘a strange campaign of things in fanzines where he was expressing his opinions of me […]. He later explained this as saying that when he started writing, he felt that he wasn’t famous enough, and that a good way of becoming famous would be to say nasty things about me’ Morrison himself refers to this too, in his book Supergods where he says, High-contrast Western manga art by my Zoids partner Steve Yeowell made Zenith’s world a frantic modernist blur of speed lines and contemporary fashions and haircuts. We announced to the world that Zenith was intended to be as dumb, sexy, and disposable as an eighties pop single: Alan Moore remixed by Stock Aitken Waterman. Keeping all the self-awareness outside the story, we used interviews and forewords to admit to our sources. In them we praised creative theft and plagiarism, quoted the French playwright Antonin Artaud and sneeringly suggested that the likes of Watchmen were pompous, stuffy, and buttock-clenchingly dour. The shock tactics I’d brought with me from the music world, delivered with the snotty whippet-thin snideness of the hipster, had helped me carve out a niche for myself as comics’ enfant terrible, and Steve was happy to play along as the handsome nice one with nothing controversial to say. My public persona was punk to the rotten core. Outspoken and mean spirited, I freely expressed contempt for the behind-the-scenes world of comics professionals, which seemed unglamorous and overwhelmingly masculine by comparison to the club and music scenes. My life was rich, and my circle of friends and family was secure enough that I could afford to play a demonic role at work. Reading interviews from the time makes my blood run cold these days, but the trash talk seemed to be working, and I was rapidly making a name for myself. Being young, good-looking, and cocky forgave many sins, a huge hit British superhero strip did the rest and proved I could back up the big talk Talking about this more recently, in David Bishop’s Thrill-Power Overload: Thirty Years of 2000 AD (Rebellion, UK, June 2007), – Sorry to interrupt here, but an interview from 2007 can’t have appeared “more recently” than the extract from “Supergods”, published in 2011, without the aid of string theory. – Morrison recalls being asked by the editorial people at 2000 AD to come up with an idea for a British superhero strip, he said, [Zenith] was very much a reaction against torment superheroes. Dark Knight is a brilliant piece of Reagan-era fiction and Watchmen is very, very clever in its architecture, but both books felt pompous and concept albumy to me as a young man in the 80s. I wanted to do something a little less self conscious perhaps, or to align myself with a different current of thinking. I had grown bored with the dull ‘realism’ of the grim ‘n’ gritty school. Brendan [McCarthy]’s work was so unique, so personal and inspirational that I was completely blown away and converted utterly to the McCarthy method – tell the truth on to the page and let your psyche all hang out. At the same time… I wanted some ‘realistic’ aspects to my story. I decided to make it about the superficial things I was into at the time: clothes, records, TV shows. Instead of creating an aspirational superhero, I gave Zenith all of my worst, most venal traits. I wanted to create a postcard from the 80s, but I also thought that if I did it without the prevailing captions and thought boxes the strip might stand up quite well on its own. My own opinion of what happened, and how I feel about it, has changed quite a bit since I started writing these three pieces. Yes, I have a lot of sympathy for Alan Moore about the things that were being said about him, but I think that it’s pretty obvious there was more than an element of the japester, the trickster, about Morrison’s writing, in particular the piece he wrote about Superfolks in his Drivel column in Speakeasy in 1990, which he makes all the more obvious in his end piece. Context! There was more than just an “…element of the japester, the trickster…” to “Drivel”. As may be deduced from one or all of the following clues: - the title. The accompanying photograph of me sneering, stripped to the waist wearing a rather pretty necklace, and flipping a ‘V’-sign. Photo Used in Drivel Column The over-the-top, bitchy and camp style of the writing – - “Drivel” was a monthly, scurrilous, humour, gossip, and opinion column in “Speakeasy”, the leading British comics magazine in 1990 when the piece in question was written. I had a brief from my editor Stuart Greene and I mostly stuck to it, except when I used “Drivel” to indulge in William Burroughs-style “cut-up” experiments. My fee for the column went to Blue Cross, so all that manufactured bile wasn’t wasted and helped make the lives of some rescue animals a little more comfortable on a monthly basis. Otherwise, the persona I adopted for “Drivel” was an exaggerated caricature partly inspired by the Morrissey interviews I enjoyed reading. The whole point of the column – which was one of the magazine’s most popular features, incidentally – was to take the piss out of the comics scene at the time. Alan Moore was only one of the many, many targets of “Drivel” and he came off lightly in comparison to some others – with whom I am still on friendly terms. The main target of the satire in “Drivel” was myself and if anyone’s reputation has suffered as a result of people in other lands and different times presenting as indictable some daft words written in jest, I’d suggest it’s been mine. In defense of my 30 year old self, he had an editorial mandate to amuse and provoke, unlike the 59 year old Alan Moore who insults, condemns and hurls baseless accusations at his contemporaries and their work in almost every interview he gives.. Does he ever, for instance, use his high media profile to do anything other than steer potential readers away from modern comic books and their creators – while over-playing his own achievements and placing himself centre stage at every turn? How hard would it be to say something encouraging, positive, or hopeful about the generally improved standard of writing in all comic books these days? Or at least say nothing at all. And if I may untangle the logic behind so much of his hectoring: Moore constantly reiterates the idea that all modern comics are copied from stuff he did in the ’80s – and they’re all rubbish! Is he genuinely saying that his influence has been entirely malignant? If he actually believed that, I’d almost feel sorry for him. I see my own influence all over the place and I’m quite chuffed. I’d also like to point out that that was over twenty years ago now, a long time to have something like that hanging over you, and this applies equally to both of them: Moore is still having it used as a stick to beat him with, and Morrison may wish that a not-terribly-serious piece he wrote as a young man, and which has cast a much longer shadow than anyone could ever have expected, would simply go away. (And, indeed, having someone like me digging it up one more time can hardly help in that, although I’m hoping that this might get to be the final, and definitive, word on the subject…) I also imagine that having someone get in touch to offer to take over writing his first major piece of work probably wasn’t received terribly well, and it’s hard to blame Moore for that, either. For a broader picture of what was happening with Alan Moore and “Warrior” at the time, I suggest asking Alan Davis (another on Moore’s list of excommunicated former collaborators) or Dez Skinn for their recollections. I’m sure it’ll be in one of those George Khoury books about Marvelman. I wasn’t part of all that. But in many ways Morrison was only doing what Moore had done before him. I can certainly recognise the punk spirit in some of what Morrison says – I’m less than 100 days older than Morrison, and I do recall that rule in punk was that everything that went before was rubbish. In hindsight, of course, there is much that was discarded that has since been reappraised, and found not to be so dreadful after all! In much the same way, when Morrison says, ‘Reading interviews from the time makes my blood run cold these days’, I imagine that one of the things he’s particularly referring to is his treatment of Moore in those early articles. My blood runs cold because I am no longer a young man but an increasingly decrepit 52 year old with a lot less arrogance, a lot more life experience, and a bit more compassion for people, even the ones I don’t particularly like. With the wisdom of hindsight, I wish I could tell my younger self that in the future, no matter how much he thought he’d changed or matured, “Drivel” would always return. These days, if I aim a barb at Moore, and I sometimes do, it’s generally as revenge for having my attention drawn to some latest interview or other. I know there’s a lot more to him than the contemptuous, patronising Scorpionic mask – we’re all just people and we all do the same daft people shit and all that – but it’s the face I’ve been exposed to more often than not, so I’m afraid my view of Alan Moore has a somewhat negative bias that deepens every time he opens his mouth to preach hellfire and damnation on the comics business and its benighted labour force. Having said that, I learned long ago to separate my antipathy toward the man’s expressed opinions from my enjoyment of his work and I’ve been very complimentary about that work over the decades. Conversely, I can guarantee you will search in vain for a single positive comment about me or my work coming from Alan Moore’s direction – in spite of our obvious shared areas of interest. I certainly think that Morrison may now regret some of his earlier actions but, particularly in this Internet age, nothing is gone, and everything is remembered. It is interesting, I think, that in his book Supergods - which itself seems to actually reflect the title of Superfolks - he doesn’t actually mention Superfolks in relation to his or Moore’s work, but in the context of having been an inspiration for Pixar’s The Incredibles Even so, Supergods has the line “Behold, I teach you the superman: He is this lightning, he is this madness!” by Friedrich Nietzsche as its epigraph, the same as Superfolks did, and Marvelman didn’t. Is this all some sort of strange cosmic coincidence, or is Morrison trying to tell us something? Honestly, I have no idea. The structure of “Supergods” is roughly based on the Qabalistic idea of the “Lightning Flash” – the zig-zagging magician’s path from the lowest material sphere of Malkuth/the material world via the various sephiroth or spheres to the highest spiritual sphere known as Kether in this system. In the same way, the book moves from the earthy foundations of the early chapters, with their focus on physicality, to the speculations, philosophies and “higher” considerations of the concluding chapters. I chose this structure for a couple of obvious reasons – firstly, because the superhero as a figure unites the mundane and the divine and secondly because every time a new “age” of comics was said to begin, I noted that it tended to be announced by a superhero wearing a lightning bolt insignia, or descended from one (as Marvelman from Captain Marvel), or came with iconic references to lightning, thunderbolts and electricity. My favourite superhero is The Flash and his emblem is a stylized, simplified echo of the right-to-left zapping course of the Qabala flash. I was very aware of the irony of re-using that hoary old Nietzsche quote but there was, quite simply, no more apposite epigraph for “Supergods”, I hope you’ll agree. The title of the book, by the way, is not a reference to “Superfolks” but to David Bowie’s song “The Supermen” which includes the lines “and supergod dies…”. So, what do I think, in the end? I think, first, that, although Grant Morrison poked fun at Alan Moore with regard to Superfolks he certainly didn’t mean it to be taken as seriously as it was, or for it to become a big stick to beat Moore with. Pádraig will need to offer more convincing evidence that my 1990 “Speakeasy” column has done the slightest harm to Alan Moore’s sales or his reputation. I’ll wager that less than 2% of the readers of “Watchmen” – still the world’s best-selling graphic novel – have heard of “Superfolks”, let alone “Speakeasy” or “Drivel” (although the proportion is likely to rise if people keep drawing attention to this very minor issue – currently it’s an item on MTV Geek). As I’ve said, it’s far easier to make the argument that Moore, along with powerful allies like Michael Moorcock, continues to indulge in clear, persistent, and often successful attempts to injure my reputation, for reasons of his own. And I really think it’s a shame that Alan Moore has such difficulty moving on from things like this, because he’s done his own share of saying mean things about Morrison, to this day. I genuinely love Moore’s work, and one of the things I love most is the sense of compassion, of redemption, that is in much of it, but reading over these pieces, it’s hard not to see Moore as the one who is perpetuating this, rather than Morrison, who only ever has good things to say about Moore’s work these days. It’s not that I don’t think that Moore has good reason to do the things he does, just that it can be difficult sometimes to see that your gods have feet of clay. In the end, though, I still love his work, and still admire him enormously as a person and as a creator. I don’t read as much of Grant Morrison’s work as I used to, mostly because I finally decided that I was giving up on superheroes for good a few years back – By only reading my work-for-hire superhero comics from 20 years ago, I feel Pádraig has missed out on most of the important stuff of my career. I hope he’ll try “The Invisibles”, “The Filth”, “All-Star Superman”, “We3″ and “Seaguy” at least. – but his work on Animal Man and Doom Patrol is still some of the best work ever done in mainstream comics, and I think that people give him a hard time which he definitely doesn’t deserve. I probably fall into that category myself, although I think I may go rethink some of those ideas now. After all, it’s never too late to change your mind. There is one final thing I want to clear up, seeing as it came up here: Whatever happened to that Kid Marvelman story that Grant Morrison sold to Dez Skinn? Dez Skinn, in Talking With Gods said about Morrison, He was such a quiet unassuming kind of guy when he’d come into the office, he was more like a fan than a professional, you know, very shy, very timid-seeming, but his work was the absolute opposite, it was totally out there, even his early stuff. I thought it was a really nice little five-pager but Alan, like any creator, I guess, who owns material, didn’t want anybody else touching his material. And here’s Dez again, this time talking in George Khoury’s Kimota! – The Marvelman Companion, Grant did submit a Kid Marvelman story, about a discussion between Kid Marvelman and a Catholic priest, and it was quite fascinating because Kid Marvelman argued a very good case against organised religion. Nobody was flying, no beams from anyone’s eyes, but a bloody clever script, clever enough that I sent it to Alan Moore for his opinion. Alan’s reply was, ‘Nobody else writes Marvelman.’ And I said to Grant, ‘I’m sorry, he’s jealously hanging on to this one.’ There is a long-standing rumour that the story was published in Fusion , a Scottish comics fanzine, but the piece in question, called ‘The Devil and Johnny Bates,’ was actually an article about Kid Marvelman by someone else. None the less, Morrison did draw two covers for Fusion including the one for , both of which are reproduced here. Yes, that is Kid Marvelman on the cover of , and Marvelman himself on the cover of . But that Kid Marvelman story never did get to see print, it seems. Which is a shame. I probably have the only surviving copy of the script. One day I’ll look it out and put it online. I seem to remember it being quite good but I made the teenage mod Johnny Bates look exactly like me, forever damning myself as Moore’s Devil! [Top photo courtesy of Jonathan Mayo] .] .” That’s a really good point. “I seem to remember it being quite good but I made the teenage mod Johnny Bates look exactly like me, forever damning myself as Moore’s Devil!” That was a great epilogue. I love both writers work. “That’s a really good point.” Only if you assume that mainstream comics actually deserve more than contempt and denunciation (which, as a whole, they don’t) or that anyone asks/has any reason to ask Moore about indie comics (which, as far as i recall they usually don’t/don’t have any real reason to). Wow. Just… Wow. I think Grant comes off really well here. Love the work of both men. Our Tupac and Biggie. And we don’t have to choose. I think THE INVISIBLES taught us there is no bad guy. “Only if you assume that mainstream comics actually deserve more than contempt and denunciation (which, as a whole, they don’t) ” So am I correct in assuming that you hold mainstream comic books to be deserving of contempt and denunciation? Nothing wrong with thinking that, of course, but I am genuinely curious as to why you think that. I said it in the comment section of Part Three of the original article and I will say it again here….I would love to buy Grant Morrison for what he is worth and sell him for WHAT HE THINKS HE’S WORTH….the ego on this guy is enormous and growing by leaps and bounds by the second….his ego is like the Hulk…the more someone questions it the angrier (or at very least, larger) it gets. GRANT’S EGO SMASH!!!! Read through the above article again and make a checklist….it’s clear that Grant is Grant’s biggest fan, taking time to mention how great Grant is at every turn even though he’s supposedly bestowing the real truth hidden by Moore’s lies. First RED paragraph……I’ve sometimes felt myself to be the victim of a genuine grudge….wow…must be tough to play the victim here Grant, especially when you previously wrote you took pride in being the punk who started crap with other creators when he was younger just to make a bigger name for himself in comics – as he described it, the enfant terrible (his words, not mine). So it’s clear we are dealing with someone who takes pride in being the “trigger” behind the gun (read: problem). Now he has the nerve to call himself a victim? A few sentences later he goes on to thank The BEAT for allowing him to “get some things off his MEDAL HEAVY chest”. Well, I’d like to pin the BIGGEST EGO PRIZE right next to all those medals, but it appears one more prize on his puffed out chest will make Mr. Happy Scribe topple over. The next few paragraphs are laden with “I”. I did this, I did that, I wrote this. I published that. I didn’t read his name (Moore) in a byline until 1982, by which time I’d been a professional writer for almost five years. I survived re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere. I cured Polio. I made love to Mother Theresa and persuaded her into becoming the force of universal peace we have all come to know and love. I, I, I, I, I….yeah…..we get it Grant. You, yourself and “I” and are clearly the greatest thing birthed on this planet. We will never forget this because you refuse to let us forget it. Moving on…after calling Alan Moore a liar ( or at least pointing out his perception of mis-information) he finishes by sugar coating his own stroke-able ego once again…..Morrison says…. Again, why the fibs, other than to reinforce once more the fantasy of me in a junior or subordinate position to himself. The Fantasy of Me as a Subordinate? How dare he? Me? Anyone dare think me a Subordinate? In Grant Morrison’s world the end game for Alan Moore is to lie so that Grant Morrison is perceived his less-than-equal. What this really tells me is, in Grant Morrison’s world he views no one his equal and will call out Alan Moore at every and all occasions to make sure we know it to. Then he takes Moore to task for bashing comics and not using his influence as arguably the biggest name ever in the medium to promote comics at any chance ( I don’t disagree with Morrison here, I think Alan should spend more time helping the industry that helped him make his bones than tossing it aside as an inconvenient step child he no longer wants to care for). But as usual, Grant finishes with a comment about his own perceived greatness because….as you well know….he hadn’t talked about how great Grant Morrison was in over a paragraph and needed to reach his every-five-minute-self-promotion quota before he got behind. He finishes with …..Is he (Moore) genuinely saying that his influence has been entirely malignant? If he actually believed that, I’d almost feel sorry for him. I see my own influence all over the place and I’m quite chuffed. Yep….I see where I have dumped my greatness on others and it makes me smile. I, Grant Morrison have shown you the love and the way…now…kiss my ring finger and be sure to leave a few bucks in the collection plate when it gets passed around. There’s more, but I would imagine you get the point. Perhaps the biggest ego point of all is the fact that Grant Morrison felt the need to come to the Beat, write his own story based on another man’s series of articles so that he can have HIS story straight. I mean, when you’re Grant Morrison, the greatest living creature in the history of existence you need to make sure all the past, present and future history books align and get it right when telling your tale. I’m sure there has been negative stuff, perhaps even downright lies written about Frank Miller, Brian Bendis, Ed Brubaker, Jason Aaron, Kurt Busiek and every other writer out there who has a following or at least a credible creative street cred. These men have all probably had someone (of note or some lowly fanboy who knows not of what he speaks) talk shit about them. mean really….Grant’s ego is so huge (and thereby so fragile) that he has to make sure he gets in an article of his own to verify and or contradict another man’s article? An article that – at its heart- was supposed to be about Alan Moore and his possible strip mining of SUPERFOLKS to create some of Alan Moore’s finest tales….yet Grant has taken the time to turn it into a piece about….well….GRANT MORRISON. Amazing how that worked out, isn’t it? I wish all internet arguments happened like this. [USER] Wayne – Wow, dude. Take a deep breath. It’s going to be ok. blacaucasian, It’s all this left over turkey…get me riled up every time…lol. Seriously….I may be over the top on this…but am I wrong? Think it over and give me your honest opinion…I would really like to know if I’m the only one who sees it this way…. Thanks. &gt;&gt; doubt Grant does, either — I’ve probably corrected more misstatements about myself online than he has, and I certainly don’t go looking for them. I think your characterization of Grant’s statements is, ehh, colorful, to say the least, but not a terribly accurate picture. I doubt he’ll be by to correct you, though. I wouldn’t have said anything myself, but you asked me a question, and it didn’t seem right to answer it and leave the impression that I thought the rest of what you said was an accurate description. kdb Fair enough KDB. Thanks for taking the time to chime in. TW I think we’re going to need to do the old “invite them both to an event without telling them the other is going” and force the two of them to work out their differences and reconcile in front of every one, as the fans need closure! “You were threatened by me? But I was just jealous of you!”. Hug. Tongue kiss. Applause. End scene. [USER] Wayne – Moore and Mozza are two of the best, if not the best two, writers in English language comics. How can you like one but hate the other, I’ll never understand. Also, I advise you not just read the red text, read the black as well – the paragraphs where Morrison gets defensive, aggressive or a little egotistic are usually preceded by a pretty harsh quote about him. He is responding to pretty direct accusations of plagiarism. Also remember, for Morrison this actually is personal. (And y’know, if you read the article, The Beat went to him asking for his response to the third part of their article about Superfolks, which was specifically about Moore and Morrison’s grudge, so probably pull back on the comments about his out of control ego – all you are doing is showing people the sort of fanboy rage criticism based on not reading any facts that Morrison himself refers to at the start). Feuds between successes based on nothing are silly to begin with, and it’s easy to laugh at the self-aggrandising statements Mozza and Moore often make in interviews – although if anyone has the right… – but I truly don’t understand harsh scorn being directed at either one. Laura, Thanks for sharing this article and creating the space for Grant to share his thoughts. Regardless of who we see as right and who is wrong , it’s really valuable to be able to get a “behind the curtain” view from these highly influential creators. It’s fascinating to peel back the layers and see what their influences were and how they perceive the effects of those influences and fellow creators on their work. I can’t help but wish for a little scholarly cold water on the whole “plagiarism” issue. Mapping out influence is a complex business. But using similar plot points as a “gotcha” game, as if this would dismiss a writer even were it true, is not only silly but rather anti-literary. As always, it’s how an artist pulls something off, its tone and effects, not the similarity of Wikipedia plot summaries. Moore and Morrison are distinct and unmistakable for one another. I admire the work of both. The great irony is that, thanks to both their work, what they’ve written will be analyzed and seriously discussed far into the future — and will endure and be loved, long after the personality conflicts involved (or the online fights between fans of “Team Morrison” or “Team Moore”) are the stuff of academic theses. If we love comics, let’s start from there. Ben, Fanboy rage criticism? A bit much…I think…but I’m willing to accept that since I was willing to give such a strong opinon on Morrison. I read the entire article…and my thoughts remain the same…does Grant Morrison not come off as a huge ego maniac? Perhaps my wording is to strong but is it not accurate? And even if The BEAT came to him looking for answers, what was written by him didn’t have to come off as ” I, GRANT MORRISON, WILL SET THINGS STRAIGHT FOR THOSE LESS INFORMED WITH ALL MY WORLDLY KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE, WELL, I AM GRANT MORRISON. Again, I am not some thin skinned punk who is willing to throw rocks from afar and then run in the opposite direction. If I am the only one who feels this way I am more than willing to admit that I may be reading more into it than I should and take all the verbal punishment I am sure will be thrown my way if, indeed, everyone agrees that I am way off base here. I just ask that you look it all over again (including the original three part series) and be sure I am entirely wrong before you call me on this – the man chose specific words to use – and those words draw a picture of how he views himself and how he thinks you should view him as well…at least I believe they do. Thomas, Does Morrison have a big ego? Sure, but so does Moore. Both make grand statements about their own genius on a regular basis – they undercut them with humour, but they do make them. (Although I’ve heard of both seem much more self-depreciating in person when they talk than when it appears in transcript). Both also talk down the others achievements as we have seen – Moore seems to have a general dislike of Morrison, whereas Morrison has specific points of grievance (or annoyance). The “feud” should be beneath them, but I think both having a big ego is fine – hopefully it continues to compel them to keep out doing themselves, and they are the super-star critical darling highly influential comics writers, so the ego isn’t undeserved. Sure, I roll my eyes a bit at Morrison’s suggested structure of Supergods, but I’ve done the same with things Moore has said to defend criticisms of his work (Neonomicon anyone?). You’ve got to give them some leeway when it comes to discussing their art/source of income. End of the day, I’ll read pretty much anything either of them release. They entertain the heck out of me, so I’d forgive a lot more from either writer. I love superhero comics, especially when two gaudily dressed, titanic titans lock horns and beat the shit out of each other in front of everyone on a regular basis. Tune in next month True Believers when marvelous Moore and God like Grant fight it out in ‘ the school playground of all our yesterdays ‘. Excelsior ! Thomas Wayne – I think you are very much reading these articles, and this one in particular, through the lens of your preconceived idea of who Grant Morrison, the distanced personality (I assume you haven’t met?), is. I spoke to him about Pádraig’s series of articles and it seemed like a good time to set the record straight – particularly as it was being picked up elsewhere, and some of the facts didn’t stack up. I should say again, that this was with Pádraig’s blessing. Much of the above is purely factual, but I’m a little amazed that “medal heavy chest”, to name one example, wasn’t seen as the humorous aside that it was intended as. Morrison is a writer after all, an entertainer. It would be a bit rubbish if aside from setting the record straight, it read like a dry old history text book. So in short, yeah I think you are getting the wrong impression here, and I’m not entirely sure where it’s coming from. One thing I’ve found time and time again in the comics industry is that – with notable exceptions – everyone is actually really friendly, praiseworthy of others that they work with and whose works they enjoy, compassionate, and genuine. Whatever else he may be, Grant is just a guy from Glasgow who spends a ridiculous number of hours writing because he loves it, who has time for anyone who wants to chat. Forrest – cheers! I can’t really take credit for this one, and Pádraig definitely deserves thanks for giving his blessing as well. It’s great that Grant has been able to put his story across in the same place the conversation was currently happening. “So in short, yeah I think you are getting the wrong impression here, and I’m not entirely sure where it’s coming from.” Oh, c’mon, everyone who’s ever read any article about Morrison at Beat knows Thomas Wayne’s MO – he hold for objective undeniable truth that Morrison destroyed Batman and Damian is da worst character in da history of da humankind and everything he’s ever wrote is da shite and popular opinion that Morrison is one of the best in comics is product of deluded simpleton minds. So no matter what amount of common sense you try to inject, his endless monologue that Morrison is the antichrist of industry will continue without break. Thomas Wayne, hiding behind a loser nom de plume, listen up. Grant Morrison owns your sad little ass. Owns it. Now go away before more people laugh at you online like they do in real life. There’s a difference between disagreeing with HOW Morrison is defending himself versus disagreeing with his defense. Sure, it might sound egotistical for him to say “I did this, I did that, all years before Moore”, etc., but is he factually incorrect? He does say some things will just be an endless he said, he said debate, but publication dates and convention appearances should be fairly easily confirmed. It just sounds like some people are attacking his post here not for what he said, but how he said it. Which I’d say could be a fair point to judge someone on, but I don’t think the other side of the argument should go without the same judgement, and there still needs to be acknowledgement of what is or isn’t fact. Thomas, Yeah, I think you may be reading a little too much into Grant’s comments, as well. First, it is not de facto egomania when someone defends their position or themselves in a public forum; in fact, what is now held by many to be self-aggrandizement was at one time expected. Second, I think we need to remember the self-deprecating sardonicism of our cousins on The Isle, especially when comparing written speech to oral speech; as was pointed out once in a transcript of an Alan Moore television interview, words which come across as gross hubris in print are wonderfully self-effacing when heard as spoken by the subject (of course, Grant’s rebuttal was intended as written speech, but I hope my point still stands). Finally, I don’t think anyone here can honestly dispute both party’s egos at work, but as I’ve always said, it ain’t braggin’ if it’s true. Fascinating stuff, if rather depressing. I wonder if some clever therapist will come up with a programme to combat the growing incidence of: ‘Comic book creator depressed by the conflict between Moore and Morrison syndrome’ (American Psychiatric Association, DSM-IV). Further reflection…. Why does this shit happen all the time? Because people like Padraig allow Moore to just spew anything and state it as fact. Hell the NY Times even did it with Alan. Sad excuse for journalism. Lighten up, Francis. You might find this interesting Superhero comics generally don’t deserve “contempt and denunciation,” but writers who produce stories that don’t say anything meaningful do. Writing an “illusion of change” story nullifies the possibility of a meaningful theme, since there’s no conflict that produces change. Unchanging villain, unchanging hero, both acting exactly as one would expect–the story doesn’t need to be written. A three-sentence summary would suffice. Superman and Wonder Woman, for example, are icons and symbols, but what’s the point of writing a story about either one that treats him or her as a symbol from start to finish? A story that turns someone into a symbol through recognition of heroic actions is vastly different from one that merely celebrates one’s status. Once a fictional character becomes a symbol, his story is (arguably) done. If a writer handling a superhero produces nothing but themeless stories, there’s no need to read them. The ones that develop the hero should be read instead. SRS Well, as a huge fan of Alan Moore and a huge fan of Grant Morrison (although I found the need to have a MorrisonCon in Vegas a little too rich for my tatstes) I think Grant has made a well reasoned well thought out argument. The problem is that Alan doesn’t frequent the ‘net(as far as I know) and everything he says or does is filtered through the eyes and minds of others. Mr. Wayne ( I’ve never understood the need to hide behind pseudonyms if you really believe in what you say you should also be unafraid of admitting being wrong when you have to) really has somekindoflove/hate relationship with Morrison and should seeagood psycho-therapist to work through his issues, his attacks seem to be sooo personal. So, what side do I chose: Team Alan or Team Grant? Just enjoy their work and be glad as a reader you’ve got both. Since this most recent eruption of the on-again, off-again “feud” between Morrison and Moore, we’ve seen some in the comics community pile on (Julian Darius termed it “Team Moore” and “Team Morrison” which sounds about right), and we’ve seen others in the community understandably wringing their hands over the fighting between two of the most admired and successful writers in the history of the medium. Not me. Don’t get me wrong. I hate fighting, and to the extent that this feud involves real people with real feelings, egos, and reputations, it’s a sad thing because it means two talented, passionate, sensitive, and (from what I can gather) two genuinely good people are experiencing pain. That’s bad in a John-Donne-Ask-Not-For-Whom-The-Bell-Tolls kind of way. However, for those of us sitting in the cheap seats, this ongoing tension has been a positive thing–not because it keeps the gossip mill grinding, but rather because it fuels so much of the artists’ work. Creative rivalries have resulted in some of the most magnificent work in history. What would Shakespeare have been without the intimidating presence of the better educated “college boys” like Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd, or the younger Ben Jonson nipping at his heels? Can you imagine modern art without Picasso and Matisse keeping tabs on one another? How much of Faulkner and Hemingway’s success came from one trying to supplant the other? And look at what happened to Marlon Brando’s career after James Dean’s death and Montgomery Clift’s car wreck. Imagine the Beatles without the Stones or the Who, or even Pearl Jam without Nirvana. How about George Carlin without Richard Pryor. Not nearly as much laughter and not nearly as much truth. Much of our greatest creative work has sprung from the disreputable wells of envy, jealousy, pride, ego, resentment, and anger. When you read through Morrison and Moore’s work (Neil Gaiman’s too), you see an ongoing “conversation” between them pasted all over it. It’s the fuel that gives us Flex Mentallo and the pride that gives us Promethea. As long as no one is drawing too much blood and both of them are able to stay healthy, to remain sane, and to keep on writing, I say let ’em fight. Laura, As I suspected it appears I have gone over the top and Grant’s ego is not as out of control as I have preceived it. Like I said, I am no thin skinned punk who throws stones at a distance. I shall take my lumps ( I mean, when someone as all-powerful as Don Murphy gives me a tongue lashing I should probably rethink my entire life strategy…perhaps join the Convent as I had wanted to as a little girl) and be a man about my choice of words- so apologies to all, especially Grant, for judging a man based on his words, or my perception of them. Keep up the good work. Morrison’s a great writer, no doubt about it. I have many of his books on my shelves and will continue to buy his works. However, it’s sad that the ultimate bad boy rebel is now a company man for DC. I don’t mind the ego if you have the goods to back it, and Morrison does, but he’s really nothing more than a public face for DC. For all Morrison’s complaints that Moore is unnecessarily harsh on modern mainstream comics and how they keep reusing his old ideas, DC sold Before Watchmen this year. There is no need to have “teams” in this…if Alan Moore ever travelled eventually there would be an Old Timers Game where both would come out and shake hands. Unlike Laura, I’ve had nothing but great interactions with both of these savants, and will continue to enjoy their work as long as I’m able to read. I’m really glad to have given Grant a chance to air his side of things. This is fun. How about the Morrison-Mark Millar feud, next time? John Shableski – it’s like Twilight all over again! Greg Carpenter – that’s a unique perspective on things, and you may well be right. Rivalry between artists and writers has been of great historical value after all. Though I do find it sad that the volume of work from Moore has surely been massively curtailed due to various falling outs with others in the industry. Could we have had several other Watchmen-calibre works from him by now if that hadn’t happened? Alas, we shall never know. Cheers Thomas, much appreciated. Chris – Morrison is a freelancer who has worked with DC many times over the years, but he is not a DC spokesperson any more than Scott Snyder, Gail Simone, or Andy Diggle etc. I’ve spoken elsewhere that I don’t believe freelance creators should be punished for their choice of employer, and the decisions that a company makes reside solely with the decision makers within the company. Beatster – but teams are fun! We could sell t-shirts ;) I should mention as well that Morrison has never been against the idea of reconciliation in the past. Suffice to say, it sadly did not happen. On the other hand I do hope no meeting is scheduled for the 21st of December… that’s one prophecy I’d rather not see fulfilled! Laura, A freelancer can be a company advocate. Morrison has gone on record often discussing his feelings in the Siegel/Shuster battles with DC and he’s sided with DC. In fact, I believe his intention of working on Action Comics was to change Superman just enough to protect the IP for DC. His dismissal of Moore’s claims against the company are hard to agree with when DC is currently publishing Before Watchmen. I understand. Morrison, like anyone with a good head on their shoulders, is looking at his future and thinking of his financial security. If he’s decided his financial security is best served by not only absolving his employer of their past sins but by helping them whitewash those sins away, well, he’s his own man and I can’t fault him for making the best decisions he can. I can find fault with the decisions themselves and his justification of those decisions, especially when I’m judging based on the man’s own words. As far as the “freelancer” term, maybe I’m being a little too absolutist, but it seems to me if an independent contractor, which a freelancer is, contracts a vast majority of their work for one company, it’s a bit misrepresentative to claim some sort of independence from that company, especially when the contractor is helping the contractor executing the decisions the company is taking criticism for. Synsidar, Thanks for elaborating. In general, I tend to agree with you, although I don’t so much use the term “theme” as that of “well-told.” Let’s face it: some absolutely dreadful superhero comics have been produced that attempted to pierce the veil, and some jaw-droppingly delightful comics have been produced where a Black Adam does nothing more than try to kick the shit out of everybody (again) for 22 pages. I think that’s the primary beauty of mainstream superhero books – you essentially tell the same tale over and over, many times reducing a character to naught more than its essence, but, when done well, you produce magic. Admittedly, it’s a rather difficult position to argue, because somewhere out there, someone honestly and fervently holds Thor Corps to be the apex of comic storytelling Great, great job Laura. Cheers to Pádraig and Heidi, too. Alan Moore kicks Grant Morrison’s and Don Murphy’s ass at the same time in a street fight! Hahahaha! Fun reading actually. How about an article why Grant Morrison and Mark Millar don’t like each other as well? Comicsbeat is easily one of the top comic book news websites! I don’t like this ugliness. Oh jeeeeeesh. In one shot Morrison has single-handedly almost totally squandered all the respect I had for him due to his not being on Twitter much or being one of those sorts of comics professionals (Breevort, Liefeld, etc) who take potshots so often. Morrison makes some decent points here and there, but the whole thing reeks of jealousy. It’s totally obvious that Morrison owes a LOT to Moore’s influence, and throughout his career Morrison’s actual comic stories have included plenty of barbs against Moore and the idea of what Moore represents to the canon. Morrison has clearly had an Oedipus Complex with Moore for decades now, and just when I thought that maybe he’d grown out of that or left it alone, he comes back with all this stuff. I genuinely understand and appreciate his trying to set the record straight, but more often than not here I get a very strong “Methinks he doth protest too much” vibe. Morrison may have been published in ’78, but he was obviously still an “aspiring” writer well after that. If he was really an established writer in his own right, he wouldn’t’ve “had” to write like Alan Moore by DC’s suggestion or whatever. It’s very true that the genius of Morrison goes well beyond Moore’s shadow, but Moore is still obviously SUCH a big part of Morrison’s artistic identity, and the very content of so much of Morrison’s work is basically predicated on reacting to (if not imitating) Moore. I mean, Moore basically gave up superheroes, especially Big Two superheroes, in 1988. But for 25 years now Morrison has been pulling every trick and double-think tactic he can think of to convince us, and himself, that wallowing supinely in Big Two superheroes is something that smart people should do, endlessly. I’m not a total homer for the guy and think he’s basically wrong on some points, but Moore’s creative range far exceeds Morrison’s. That Morrison can pull out evidence about out “I was doing crappy forgetable indie work in ’78, before Moore!” or “I was into stupid magick FOR REALZ a year before Moore REALLY said he was!” is kind of pathetic, since those aspects of Morrison’s work and character just aren’t all that deep. And Zenith was more than just “a little” based on Marvel Man and Captain Britain… [USER] If Morrison vs Moore is comics Tupac vs Biggie I really hope it doesn’t end with some fan taking things way to seriously and shoot both writers. This article by Grant Morrison is a farce: Those of us who were reading comics back in the day, know he hugely ripped off Brendan McCarthy’s work which was, in the 80s, a stylish, subversive alternative to Alan Moore’s ‘grim’ comics style. The work that McCarthy and his writing partner Peter Milligan produced, like the punk-surrealist ‘Strange Days’, was akin to The Velvet Underground in comics: stuff like Zenith was just a blatant steal from their earlier Paradax strip. McCarthy is on record saying that he invented ‘Danny the Street’ (the most memorable character in what was a pretty good Doom Patrol run), and has expressed annoyance that Morrison subsequently claimed it for himself. Eventually McCarthy stopped working in comics after the swansong ‘Rogan Gosh’ (the ‘suicide on the phone’ motif duly ripped off for Flex Mentallo). Probably got fed up with seeing his ideas stolen by Morrison. Both Morrison and Moore can be decent writers, but are a pair of deeply dishonest bullshitters. They deserve each other. [USER] “I’m not a total homer for the guy…” Homer? for those debating the goodness of superhero comics up there…. that’s not the point. moore in many ways is just as deprecating of indie/web/non superhero stuff. and of course his spiel always begins with the words ‘i haven’t read any of this, but….’ so, yeah, comicdom’s most famous ambassador probably could do with a being less of a pranny. [USER] Mur. [USER] cantor – Brendan Mcarthy designed Zenith, so outrage over being robbed wasn’t why he left comics, and his leaving comics was rather temporary as he’s been at it again for a few years now. I’ve made a jokey comment above: “I wonder if some clever therapist will come up with a programme to combat the growing incidence of: ‘Comic book creator depressed by the conflict between Moore and Morrison syndrome’ (American Psychiatric Association, DSM-IV).” But, in all seriousness, as a comic book writer myself who has been deeply influenced by both men I do find it depressing and disturbing. It’s a bit like a kid’s parents constantly fighting and the kid suffering a degree of disorientation as a consequence. I feel like that character on the Simpsons who shouts out: “Won’t somebody think of the children!” Greg Carpenter makes a good point that such rivalry is often productive, leading people on to more achievement. I am not sure how much that is the case here, or if any of the books they two wrote would not have been written if they had been friendly. The key motivation for them to write was not to better the other, I’m sure. Anyway, I’m talking about the disillusioning affect that their bitter squabbling has on other creators who have been influenced by Moore and/or Morrison. I’m not the only one suffering the syndrome, am I? I say ‘creators’ especially here (although readers in general are affected of course) because as a creator we have given a considerable part of our lives to making comic books (rather than the other roads we could have taken), so it’s obviously important to us. We have done so partly under the influence of older creators or characters or stories that fired us up in some way. There is inevitably a bit of a ‘looking up’ to those creators involved in that, partly because of the age and status differences there when you are a younger creator just starting out. So, there’s likely to be a disorientating and disillusioning aspect if we find out that the ‘wise old man’ figure in your personal mythology is, ah, a bit of a cunt. I’m being frivolous again, and not saying either Moore or Morrison is such, but you get my point I hope. We could be a bit crude and boring and just say about this whole trouble: ‘that’s life, people fall out – get over it’. But I’m drawing on the Joseph Campbell ‘wise old man’ bit deliberately here as it does seem to me that something of that nature may be going on, or its fun to put it into that frame anyway. So, the disorientating and disillusioning affect of finding your heroes are not the shining ideal you once thought they were leads, if we keep at the quest and face these trials and tribulation, to a higher personal state. As he man himself writes: “For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father-face, then one’s faith must be centered elsewhere…” (The Hero With a Thousand Faces, p110) So, to summarise and be silly again – we may be transforming via Moore and Morrison into, ah, Moses. Or since I live in Japan, let’s say via Busiek into… Buddha. Hey Laura, This post has been a great read and the commentary has added quite a bit. Like many, I too have enjoyed their works the funny thing to me is the additional ‘colour’ they bring out of the readership. Don Murphy is the most hated man in the movie industry, which is saying something.. His vendetta against Moore (who loathes Murphy’s shitty films in a very public way) is well known, but his support for Morrison (who can’t get a movie going – unlike his other arch-villain Mark Millar) seems misplaced. As the jackanapes who asked Moore the question on that webchat… The unintelligible mumbling bit of the transcript around the word Vertigo has, I think, led Morrison to respond to a claim other than what Moore made at the time. If I recall, Moore’s claim was not that Berger brought Morrison in for Vertigo, but something along the lines of “what became Vertigo,” referring to the late-80s/early 90s “Berger books” that included Animal Man, Swamp Thing, Sandman, Doom Patrol, and Shade: The Changing Man. In this regard Morrison’s comments about the founding of Vertigo some years later are almost, but not entirely, irrelevant to the point Moore was making. I’m glad to see Grant Morrison sticking up for himself here; he’s usually pretty quiet on his view of ‘the feud’, and I was curious as to his full side of the story. And I’m glad to find out where the Supergods title comes from! Nice one, Mr. M. I’m curious as to why Morrison’s own testimony from Talking with God’s isn’t referenced here as it seems a bit at odds with some of the comments he has above. In it he himself says that he “DC started to recruit because Alan’s Swamp Thing had been very successful. They said they’d give me a call and it was one of those moments .. oh god DC calling.” In other words he admits DC was was interested in him because of Moore. Whether it was because they wanted someone like him or someone directed them to him we don’t know. However, Berger says in this meeting Morrison came up with a number ideas including Animal Man which Morrison states he pitched with a “sub-Moore” approach because that’s what I though Karen wanted.” Also interesting is J.H. Williams’ comment that he sensed Grant just “has to poke at him (Moore) .. I just get the feeling. I have no horse in this race but again if you’re going to build a rebuttal in the voice of Morrison the documentary would seem have some interesting perspective. “…Alan Moore had fallen out with DC over the “For Mature Readers” ratings system…” Incidentally, all but one issues of “Dodgem Logic” had the words “FOR ADULTS ONLY” on the cover. I don’t think Morrison is saying that the success of Moore was in no way influential when it comes to what kind of story DC was looking to tell (he says as much above when talking about the style of the initial Animal Man issues), or which nationality of creators was rich for the plunder, but rather that had Moore not had that success, that the other UK creators would not have stopped pitching, and would not have stopped writing. and that interests had already been expressed. Moore too has spoken more than once of Vertigo being an “Alan Moore farm” which I feel is a little disrespectful towards Karen Berger – Vertigo has produced some of the most important works of the last few decades, and while Moore was the bees knees at the time, the variety and quality of styles coming out of that imprint are under no man’s shadow. “Who influenced/ripped off who” is a bit of a dead end track to be honest, an issue explores in detail in the sequart trackback below, and perhaps something we will come back to later. I think it’s important to note that Morrison has told parts of his history in numerous interviews over the years, and indeed in a documentary, but generally these things have to fit to a narrative. To be entertaining and so on. This piece here is a rebuttal in its simplest form – just the facts ma’am! – and untouched by editor hands. (As an aside – yay for no hatemail! I do like it when I avoid that ^_^ And an aside aside, Morrison really doesn’t seem like a jealous fella to me – he praises Moore’s works repeatedly when he could just avoid all mention, and he comes across as a very peaceful and compassionate person. Why would he be jealous? He’s pretty much doing everything any aspiring writer could want to do, and having fun doing it. IMO.) I’m really glad to read Morrison’s take on things. He’s clearly more level headed and fact based than Moore in his assertions. In my opinion Moore has a handful of good works that aren’t as groundbreaking as he and a lot of fans make them out to be. Morrison on the other hand has a long career of books that are as good if not better than what Moore did. Even when Grant doesn’t like what another writer is doing with something, he’s not yelling that the guy is a hack and thoughtless. So he doesn’t like how Animal Man is going? He’s not telling everyone Jeff Lemire is creatively bankrupt and that no one should buy his book. He just says he would (and did) do it differently. No biggie, a simple difference of opinion. Which is why I like Morrison and his books a hell of a lot more than I like Moore and his. For anyone curious to check out Talking With Gods, the Morrison doc, it’s on Youtube here: and also available on Hulu if you’re in the US. Wow Thomas Wayne, you need some help. Try some Medical Marijuana. I’m a big fan of both writers. *Sorry Grant…….. but Moore is absolutely right on the things he said about Geoff Johns. By the way, there was a really great decoding of Final Crisis by Argentinean magazine Comiqueando (a classic magazine in latin America), which said that basically the story was Morrison denouncing Moore for starting the whole “grim-and-gritty superheroes” era (I haven’t read Final Crisis and it’s been a while since I read the magazine article, so I might be oversimplifying things, but I remember that was basically what the article said). According to the article, the evil monitor Mandaark (who in the story used to be the best of the monitors, but had turned evil) was supposed to be an allegory of Moore. Surprinsingly, I haven’t seen this analysis in English-written comics websites (not that I’ve been looking for it, though). Nothing beats 13,546 issue ‘stories’ that can be done well in just 4 comics like a bunch of overpaid old farts sniping at each other. In the ’90s, when Alan Moore was writing Supreme for Liefeld’s company, he had lots of projects ready for his artists. Then Liefeld’s company went bankrupt. Moore, in order to get quick gigs for his artists – some were stuck with bills, mortgages, etc. – relinquished the creator rights of Tom Strong, Promethea, Top Ten, just so the artists could get money upfront faster. This was a man who had been in an epic fight over the rights of Watchmen, and he gave his rights away again, not for his personal gain, but for the sake of his artists. What has Morrison ever done that is so noble and selfless? Like the little bastard says, he owns everything he’s ever written from Captain Clyde onwards. In Supergods, Morrison claims that Gardner Fox was fired because his style was outdated and DC wanted new voices. I had to discover the truth in an Alan Moore interview: Gardner Fox was fired because he helped organized a writers’ union to demand better rights. Expect MOore to teach you comics history in interviews, and Morrison to defend his employers. When McFarlane asked Moore to write Spawn, Moore asked the regular paying rate, even though McFarlane wanted to pay him more than the other people at Image. In the introduction to Milligan’s Enigma, Morrison confesses that he was invited to the celebrated Italian Lucca Festival, and then he pretended to be sick, and got himself free vacations without bothering to attend the festival. What a dishonest little man! Reading Alan Moore’s interviews from the ’80s to now, one gets the impression he’s always the same person, with the same convictions and voice. Reading Morrison from the ’80s to now is like meeting a different person each time: he has no convictions, no moral positions, no beliefs, nothing, he just flows with the current and bends according to situations and whatever suits. So anarchist in the ’90s, and corporate yes man in the ’00s. The feud to me only matters in one topic: who’s the most morally upstanding person. And I don’t have any doubts Moore takes the prize. It’s odd to say Grant owning his own material is a bad thing, when so many of Moore’s issues with his employers arise from creator ownership, not to mention the fact that Grant actually owns very little stuff out right (most of his creator owned stuff is locked in Vertigo creator owned but not controlled limbo). Present day Image comics creators make the choice to forsake an upfront payment in favor of having full creator ownership. Moore chose to go the opposite direction with ABC and sacrifice his rights in favor of getting payment upfront for himself and his artists. You can argue for both choices, but I’m guessing it was partially to get his own upfront payment as well, since he often seems to take work purely for financial reasons (i.e. writing Neonomicon to pay a tax bill). If Moore is such a benevolent and giving collaborator, why has he wound up on the outs with so many people he’s collaborated with over the years, while Grant has generally good relationships with everyone except for a couple of notables (i.e. Moore, Millar)? Glad to see GM defend himself. I lost a bit of respect for Moorcock years ago after reading some of his comments and the Moore/Moorcock tag team is pretty sad. Mixed feelings about this. The resorting to the old Versus narrative should be incredibly boring and sad Laura, Padraig and Grant indulged in it. As it is, they’re reasonable, balanced and good writers making this a good read, and Grant made me chuckle on a few occasions. I’m sure the initial fallout in the 80s was particularly upsetting then and will continue to be so each time this topic rears it’s head. It’ll be ten or twenty years maybe before writers get round to rearing my feuds with comixer contemporaries, so can we writers maybe change the text before then? A few points: Morrison’s insinuations that Moore got “metafiction” from him appear to be highly questionable: 1) Morrison’s Animal Man is extremely similar to the Alan Moore comic strip from 1978 “St. Pancras Panda” Back Street Bugle , August 15 – September 11, 1978 where the Panda exists the comic and meets Alan Moore, who calls himself God. Morrison appears to be aware of it since he mentions it in the interview. 2) Moore did metafiction before Morrison, both in that Panda strip and “In Pictopia” released in 1986. 3) Morrison did not create comic book limbo as he claims. A brief look at Wikipedia states “Limbo refers to a fictional location in books published by DC Comics. Limbo first appeared in Ambush Bug (vol. 1) (August 1985), and was created by Keith Giffen. [edit]History In Ambush Bug (vol. 1) , Jonni DC mentions removing Wonder Tot from DC continuity having “dumped her in Limbo.”[1] Ambush Bug later returns to Limbo in Son of Ambush Bug .” If Supreme was influenced by anything, it would likely be Keith Giffen. (Although its conceivable Morrison was also an influence, there’s no evidence to suggest it.) Patrick Meaney: I bring up Morrison’s owning his original work because he has used it to gloat on the internet, as a reason why he doesn’t care about the creator rights struggles and injustices happening around him. And to establish a contrast with Alan Moore, who, in spite of his struggles in favour of creators rights, is willing to give away his rights in order to help his fellow artists. My question is, when did Morrison ever so something that selfless for an artist? And I don’t have reasons to believe Moore did it for the money. Moore has refused the royalties of his film adaptations, he’s refused millionaire deals with DC over the years. Moore simply has principles, which is something I understand is hard to comprehend in this dog-eat-dog world. And when Moore is writing for the money, you can tell. You’re not going to tell me Promethea and Neonomicon have anything in common, are you, in terms of depth, theme, structure, characterisation, innovation? So I’ll continue to believe his version of the ABC line, until facts prove otherwise. Why doesn’t Moore have good relationships with his collaborators? You’d have to ask them, or Moore. I’d presume it’s a mixture of several things: 1) Moore’s outspoken, confrontational personality, which is the opposite of the one seen in the industry – everyone pretending everything is always chummy all the time, the myth of the Marvel Bullpen, finally blown to bits by Marvel: The Untold Story; 2) Moore’s collaborators eventually having to work for DC and Marvel, which forces them to be defensive of their employees; 3) and Moore probably not being an easy person to work with. I’d liken him to Jim Shooter, an editor reviled for micro-management but who steered one of the best ages of Marvel, with lots of classic runs. Perhaps people like Moore and Shooter just have too high an expectation of their collaborators. I know I never looked at a Morrison comic book and thought, ‘He really brought out the best in his artist!” Morrison is liked by everyone (except, I presume, Chris Ware and Dan Clowes) because he simply avoids conflicts. He’s never said anything controversial, never stood up for rights, Morrison just wants to work and he’ll behave in order to work for a living. Moore never had problems burning bridges. In this age when we’re starting to see more and more writers and artists finally blowing the lid and expressing what they really think about Marvel and DC, it’s time we finally start seeing Moore as a pioneer. Comics can only improve if more and more creators expose the injustices within the companies. Sadly this says it all, “to get some things off my medal-heavy chest”. He doesn’t mention the dry-humping of Before Watchmen. He only points to ‘2’ works of Moore, yet barrages off a litany of his works. I really want to give him a fair go, after not so with ‘part 3′ of the article. And seriously I can’t read mainstream comics which now goes in circles with renumbering, re-titling etc. Indie comics and Indie writers are going to save the industry, because, DC and Marvel are not going to. Its probably why GM took his book ‘Happy’ to Image . Ahem… just like Alan Moore did so many years ago. Just put on ‘V’ mask GM, you know you want to. interestedfan – that is indeed the point, that such “convincing” conjecture, in either direction, is daft and unnecessary. Miguel – “Morrison is liked by everyone (except, I presume, Chris Ware and Dan Clowes) because he simply avoids conflicts.”. Aru Singh – “to get some things off my medal-heavy chest” is a joke, but I guess a good example of how people choose not to see the joke when they could instead take a meaner interpretation. Before Watchmen was originally on the cards to be discussed, but we felt it would be too derailing from Pádraig’s original intentions and perhaps better fits a later discussion. As it is, it’s the three articles here that were being responded to. I’m slightly amused that coverage of this elsewhere labels Pádraig as a scholar and myself as a reporter – guess you can’t be the former if you write about Morrison! ಠ_ಠ Aru – I feel the need to interject. Moore went to Image when it first started, and when it was publishing Youngblood, Wildcats, Spawn etc. – i.e. a lot of crap dressed up in flash and thunder, rather than the “indie” powerhouse it is today. His first work for them was an issue of Spawn Todd McFarlane asked him to do, and McFarlane paid VERY well – there’s no shame in taking a work for the money, and Moore has always tried to write a good story regardless of the situation, but it’s not quite comparable to why Morrison’s getting Happy! published through Image, considering Moore was writing other people’s titles. How else do you explain his work on Wildcats, Supreme (fine work, but based on another artist’s character regardless), Youngblood, and the eternal classic Violator/Badrock? “medal-heavy chest” is a joke in the same way that Ricky’s Gervais’ ironic references to his Emmy awards etc are jokes e.g. its self aggrandisement masquerading as self deprecation. A few things should be pointed out here: the comments by Alan Moore that Morrison is largely concerned with refuting and responding to here were spontaneous thoughts expressed on a live online web chat as a response to a question he didn’t know would be asked (all questions were submitted live by viewers) (He also didn’t arbitrarily slate Morrison, the question was specifically about the nature of Moore’s relationship with him). To take this article as Moore’s viewpoint vs Morrison’s is very lopsided as Morrison has the advantage of writing from the position of having the time to deliberate and rationalize his views. Moore’s comments were off the cuff and lasted a few minutes; Morrison has seemingly spent a long time thinking about and writing this piece. If Alan Moore were to write a similar piece ( and there’s no doubt at all that he never will) then maybe it would be a fair ‘battle’. As always of course, if you actually watch the footage (and it is online somewhere or other; i’ve watched it) you will see that there is a more playful tone in what Alan Moore says than you would think merely from the text. This doesn’t mean he can’t actually have meant the words but there is a double standard being applied here: Morrison rails against his own frivolous words being brought up to beat him with but misses the point that perhaps Moore too has spoken frivolously in his time? Why do his comments have to have been informed by nothing but spite and bad will towards Morrison (and to be totally without any sense of humour or mischief) but Morrison can say his were purely for effect and mischief and therefore should be discounted as being his actual views? Let’s apply an equal criteria to both men here. One more point: for someone claiming to want to address the ‘issue’ with facts Morrison should have trimmed his coments to exclude such second-hand suppositions as knowing Moore reads his work because some nameless creator told him so. Not only is it totally insubstantial as a claim it has the unfortunate cumulative effect of suggesting resentment on Morrison’s part. “I’m slightly amused that coverage of this elsewhere labels Pádraig as a scholar and myself as a reporter – guess you can’t be the former if you write about Morrison! ಠ_ಠ” Laura, maybe it is to do with the tone and content of your respective pieces? Paidrag’s article was about a point of interest in an author’s work (the influences behind certain elements of Alan Moore’s work) and your follow up ‘article’ changes that into more of a ‘he said / she said’ debate ie. tabloid tittle tattle. You haven’t done any scholarly work here, you have simply presented a platform to someone you acknowledge as a friend. So personally, i would say the two tags were suitably given in this instance. I also feel obliged to say that you are disingenuous with certain things you wrote: ” While Moore has previously spoken out about his thoughts on Morrison in various interviews, Morrison has generally kept quiet on the issue.” Now, i’m sure you know that the two names should be reversed in that sentence. Moore has maybe a few quotations to his name regarding Morrison (and I have an exceptionally deep archive of Alan Moore interviews, as I know does Paidrag; you have to search pretty deeply or have Paidrag’s kind of knowledge to find more than a couple of Moore quotes about Morrison), which are usually prompted by being asked about him (as in the example in this article), whereas Morrison has made many ad hominem comments about Moore, something he acknowledges himself in the article: “These days, if I aim a barb at Moore, and I sometimes do, it’s generally as revenge for having my attention drawn to some latest interview or other.” Here we have the same double standard I mentioned in my comment above: ‘barbs’ aimed at Morrison by Moore in ‘revenge’ at having his ‘attention drawn’ to Morrison are not okay, but perfectly acceptable the other way around. In fact, Moore rarely gets asked about Morrison but Morrison often gets asked about Moore and the reason for that is because Moore’s influence and reputation is greater within the field of comics and massively greater in the wider world beyond comics. And, sorry to say, Morrison’s comments here and elsewhere do seem to drip with resentment about that fact: “Conversely, I can guarantee you will search in vain for a single positive comment about me or my work coming from Alan Moore’s direction – in spite of our obvious shared areas of interest.” Steven – I actually don’t think any of the pieces in this series are scholarly, but that’s rather beside the point I was making. Tabloid? Really? Sigh.. What if Alan is just cranky because he has been cosplaying as Tom O’Bedlam all this time and nobody noticed? Mrs. Sneddon: ”. I realize this will be hard for you to understand, Sneddon, but Moore doesn’t have the temperament of a comic book writer. He’s the only comic book writer I know who thinks, speaks and acts like a great novelist. He’s a well of contradictions, like most great novelists, preaching one thing and doing another. He’s frank, outspoken, erudite, principled, and rancorous. I admire him a lot for that. Better that than the spineless comic book writers who continue to project the illusion that everything is hunky-dory in the comics industry, when every year we see one new creator exploding in public about what’s going on in the backstage – Chris Roberson, Greg Rucka, Ed Brubaker, etc. If Moore feels insulted, attacked, or offended, I prefer he shows that in public rather than pretend the world is all sunshine. How do you know Gibbons, Lloyd et all are ‘nice blokes’? Because they gave you an interview? Do you live inside their heads? Do you know their secrets? They’re entertainers, they live off entertaining people, of course they’ll project an image of nice, cool, easy-going lads. They don’t want to wash their dirty laundry in public. Moore doesn’t have a problem doing it, and I admired him for that. .” There’s nothing selfless about Happy! Morrison is realizing where the wind is blowing, he has finally understood that with Vertigo’s restrictive contracts he won’t get the movies and TV shows everyone else is getting. You can tell he’s hurt no one’s turning his comics into movies, he keeps complaining about that in interviews. So he’s going to Image with a mediocre comic book screaming to be turned into a mindless cool action movie. It’s sad to see the writer of The Invisibles deliver a comic book Mark Millar could have authored, but that’s how the mighty fall. I also assume Morrison’s collaborators don’t have complaints and continue to request working with him because he’s always published by DC/Vertigo, which pays well, and because his comics sell well. So it’s an intelligent decision to work with him. If he continues to write at Image, however, it’ll be interesting to see if many artists are willing to join him. We’ll see what loyalty exists when they stop receiving big DC paychecks upfront. Sneddon: .” Alan Moore doesn’t mention Morrison once in the lengthy book of interviews Portrait of an Extraordinary Gentleman. Moore very rarely will speak about Morrison. Morrison, however, has been attacking him since the ’80s, as the Drivel column shows, and in recent years in Supergods and then in a Rolling Stones interview where he accused him of being obsessed with rape. With due respect, Sneddon, you’re not much an investigative journalist. You’re not Naomi Klein, that’s for sure. Miguel, where does Laura Sneddon claim to be an investigative reporter? She mentions GM’s barb’s in the 3rd sentence so I think she knows about no beard poking at all beard. As for your earlier comment about the Marvel Bullpen, the myth of that has been public record for decades before Howe’s book. [USER] Couple of points: when did Ed Brubaker “explode in public about what’s going on backstage” in corporate comics? I’ve missed that one, all I’ve seen from him is a calm and reasonable statement about the increased frequency of Marvel’s release schedule as the main reason for leaving Winter Soldier, in addition to his creator-owned and movie/tv work. Was there anything more sinister than that? Examples please if there was. Also upbraiding someone for saying a person is a nice bloke and asking if they live in their head, know their secrets, thoughts etc and then going on to ascribing thoughts and motivations for why creators are collaborating with Morrison at Image is quite the leap in logic as you’re doing the exact some thing you berated a person for a few paragraphs prior. Fair to say Laura is more qualified to say if Lloyd or Gibbons are a nice bloke because she has actually interacted with them and can come to the conclusion while you have no idea about the motivations and monetary rewards for why a Darick Robertson, for example, would collaborate with Morrison at Image besides your own wild hunches (a hunch of my own: he wants to work with him. As has many an acclaimed artist and continue to do so; cf. Frank Quitely, JH Williams, Frazer Irving and so on). Sadly the list of acclaimed artists Moore can work with is ever dwindling, whether it be by their own corporate associations or being blacklisted by the bearded one himself. [USER], [USER] Sneddon, [USER]: Given the success of this series, particularly this latest offering, any chance of some textual analysis of the Moore/Morrison feud? That would be a lot more fun than simple he said/he said transcribing, use actual published examples and what they have to say! Off the top of my head, for Moore the Jimmy Olsen analogue was a very pointed critique in Supreme, bordering on unfairly. For Morrison it seems more satirical and gentle ribbing, such as the Beard Hunter in Doom Patrol and All-Beard/No-Beard in Seven Soldiers: Manhattan Guardian, and a more general critique of Moore’s influence on superhero comics as a medium via Mandrakk in Final Crisis. ” Off the top of my head, for Moore the Jimmy Olsen analogue was a very pointed critique in Supreme, bordering on unfairly. ” What makes you think the Jimmy Olsen analogue is commenting on Morrison? I think you are COMPLETELY misreading it. He’s clearly an Alan Moore self parody. He kills the super dog and has Omniman rip his own heart out: similar to things that happened in “What Ever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow”: Bizarro rips his heart (actually I’m not sure about that, can’t remember if he dies from ripping his heart out or kryptonite poisoning) out and Krypto dies. He also writes “The Rape ordeal of Omni-Dog” which can be seen as a parody of Moore’s rape ordeal stuff with Kid Marvelman. Later, in Tomorrow Stories, Moore directly parodies Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow again in First American, where First American writes the fan fiction where “all the comedy villains turn into serial killers.” He also has an intro that says (going from memory) “This is an imaginary story, that may happen, but then again won’t” there’s no ambiguity about it being self parody. Although to be fair, the Supreme annotations online state “Page 2: Moore has clearly positioned Billy Friday as a satire of the “avant garde” British comics authors of the eighties including Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, and Moore himself who introduced a climate of revisionism to comics. Moore has said in recent interviews that he now believes this revisionism stripped superhero comics of everything that once made them charming and clever; this series may be seen as his attempt at atonement.” I’m not seeing any actual references to Morrison, though, despite what the annotations claim. Also Mandrakk (The lame Darth Vader ripoff) being Alan Moore sounds like really stupid fan gossip nonsense. Sometimes a lame Darth Vader knockoff is just a lame Darth Vader knockoff. [USER] Grant isn’t leaving Vertigo, Image is publishing Happy because he wants to be part of Image Revolution and he knows from previous discussions that Karen Berger is uncomfortable with stories that put children in sexual peril. In fact there are projects Morrison is developing with Vertigo.. interestedfan, what are the similarities between Vader and Mandrakk? “interestedfan, what are the similarities between Vader and Mandrakk?” Been a while since I read Final Crisis, but in the last issue, don’t they reveal he’s the boy’s father (“Luke, I am your father!”) Isn’t he some good guy turned bad? His whole schtick is that he’s the primal villain in the primal first story, the basis of all stories, and Star Wars is supposed to be doing the whole Joseph Campbell basic hero of a thousand faces myth thing, kid verse evil dad. And like Star Wars, (and unlike any myth I can name) they save the reveal until later, rather than saying the bad guy is the boy’s dad upfront. It’s pretty bizarre to claim Mandrake is Moore, it’s like saying he’s the creator of the DC Universe and came up with everything at DC comics, it would place him at the center of every idea at DC. If you accept that Mandrake is Moore, you have to reject the notion that Morrison’s stuff isn’t derivative of Moore, it would be an acknowledgment that every DC comic descends from More and is derivative of Alan More. Miguel – so comic writers are spineless and novel writers are above reproach? Hmm. Also, I am neither “Mrs”, nor “Sneddon” – my name is Laura Sneddon or Laura, ta very much. No need for rudeness in this rather lovely part of the internet!. Let’s not pretend you are giving me any due respect though, I think it’s rather obvious you are not. From CBR: RE: Rollingstone Interview!” Whether its true or not, for someone who supposedly isn’t throwing out barbs, this is very loaded to say the least. Rest abridged interview here: -Aru Singh Pessoa: .” I often read Morrison praise the works of other DC employees. Beyond the Big Two, Morrison has no interest in comics. He’s publicly attacked or dismissed the work of Dan Clowes, Chris Ware, the Hernandez brothers, The Comics Journal and Fantagraphics. If an interviewer gets Moore to talk about comics history, though, he’ll only have praise to people like Winsor McCay, Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Robert Crumb, etc, an eclectic range of comics. Thanks to him I discovered an excellent 1960s comic called Herbie Popnecker. Morrison never made me discover any classics. It’s true Moore doesn’t praise modern comics, but if he doesn’t believe they’re good, why should he praise them? His standards are different than Morrison’s, obviously. As for Moore’s style, it works for him, it has led to masterpieces like V for Vendetta, Marvelman, Watchmen, Swamp Thing, From Hell, Supreme, Tom Strong, Promethea, Top Ten. Each writer should write the way he wants, I don’t even understand why this is an issue or what relevance it has to this discussion. I will however say that I don’t believe Lloyd, Gibbons, Williams III and a few others were ever as good as when they were turning Moore’s dense scripts into pictures. He may he difficult, but obviously something about his writing brings the best in his collaborators. Of Gibbons, for instance, one can’t honestly say that the work he did a few years for Green Lantern is on the level of Watchmen. Sneddon: “so comic writers are spineless and novel writers are above reproach?” Novelists (and writers from outside comics in general), from my experience, are outspoken and confrontational if they think they’re in the right. It’s not uncommon for writers to have falling outs. I can point out a few, for instance: Gabriel García Márquez and Mario Vargas Llosa; Derek Walcott and V.S. Naipaul; Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda; José Saramago and António Lobo Antunes. Only in comics do we have an atmosphere of secrecy and complacency where everyone is obliged to be friendly to everyone else, sometimes just for appearance’s sake. I don’t think that’s healthy, because it curtails a critical spirit. Only dictators like to make people think everything is hunky-dory and orderly within their realms. I’ve read enough cases about creators being exploited and blacklisted in comics and being reneged by their own peers out of loyalty to their immoral employees. Most people are afraid of speaking out because they don’t want to burn bridges with DC and Marvel, comics major employers. If Moore has such standards that others can’t reach, perhaps he’s not the one to blame, perhaps we should hope more would be like him. .” It’s only bizarre if you think everyone should be friendly with everyone. Sometimes people are simply worthy of our contempt and spite. We live in a world where the pressure to be like everyone else is immense. Moore has resisted and has carved out his own life for himself, on his terms. He has the life he wants, and I’m sure he can live with the consequences of his decisions. ” Sometimes people are simply worthy of our contempt and spite. “Yes i think you illustrated your point, but probably not in the way you intended. Laura, are you sure Grant is “kept quite quiet” about Alan Moore? Just read the several interviews that Grant gave and realize that he is the one atacking Moore since the early years. And it’s not my opinion, it’s a fact that you can check anytime you want reading his interviews. And even the Talking with Gods documentaries. It’s quite clear your preference for Grant Morrison, but I don’t think it’s a good thing to do when you decide to choose any sides… specially when you are writing and article like this. Please, let’s try to be impartial on this. Cheers. Robson – I think he has kept quite quiet yes, apart from the barbs which I mentioned – and which people keep skipping that I have mentioned ⊙﹏⊙ I do not think Grant is a saint, I’m sure he’d laugh at the thought, but quite quiet is quite fair. And quite subjective of course! George Bush (not that one) – I like you I do. I do not feel contempt nor spite for anyone, even those who have given me real cause over the years. I knew I was a hippy but I’m happy to be a bizarre one too! It should be noted that Morrison loves a good rape plot thread himself, and his statements about Moore are probably just bad faith. Off the top of my head: 1) Seven Soldiers have the rape and pillage bad guys, one of whom says “Rape Good!” in shining night (If I remember correctly) 2) The rapey bane Batman knockoff and the creepy pedophile priest black glove member in Batman 3) Extended rape plotline in The Invisibles with Fanny, as well as mind control rape villains 4) Final Crises has Marvel Marvel physically and emotionally violated, and its implied she goes around raping people while possessed by Dessad. 5) Sexual abuse plotline in Doom Patrol 6) Villain just threatened to rape Talia and turn her into a prostitute in her backstory issue in Batman Inc. If Morrison really cared about how female comic characters are treated, he wouldn’t be cheer leading DC Comics the way he does. If you wish to be thorough, don’t forget he added child molestation to the backstory of Golden Age boy character Kid Eternity, the detective of The Mystery Play is a child rapist, and Mad Hatter in Arkham Asylum is implied to be a child molester too. I’m not squeamish so I don’t care about rape in fiction, how many rapes Moore and Morrison have in their work is just an absurd point; his comment is only relevant in so far as it reveals that he says things without thinking them through, he’d do everyone a favour if he simply refrained from making these bombastic and controversial commentaries he adores to provoke scandal. “he’d do everyone a favour if he simply refrained from making these bombastic and controversial commentaries he adores to provoke scandal.” Great advice Miguel. Why don’t you lead by example. As much as I’d like to think otherwise, I’m sadly too insignificant for my bombastic commentaries to provoke any public scandal. [USER] You don’t care rape in fiction but you compleated the list of interestedfan. The rape plotline in Doom Patrol is one of the best stories about a girl sexually abused. By the way, Crazy Jane is one of the best female characters. I love her solo story in the epilogue of Morrison’s run in Doom Patrol. You insist freelancer Grant is a DC employee, it must be the example of your idol that called his ex-partner Dave Gibbons a DC employee. I didn’t read any interview where he dismisses the works of Clowes, Ware or Hernandez Brothers, but Grant has the right to have a opinion. In fact he praised Tales Designed to Thrizzle published by Fantagraphics and wrote the preface of True Faith written by the newbie Garth Ennis. He said good things about Marvel writers like Ed Brubaker, Jonathan Hickman and Brian Bendis and he likes so much Image that he wanted do take a part of Image Revolution. It looks like the admirers of Moore think all the quality of his works lie on the talent of the writer, but Swamp Thing, Watchmen, V for Vendetta and Promethea wouldn’t have the same success without accomplished artists like Stephen Bissette, Dave Gibbons, David Lloyd and JH Williams. In a recent comicon, Morrison, Vaughan and Hickman praised the hard work of the artists and recognised their importance. Moore doesn’t have the same love Morrison has for comics as a media. Comics have to adapt to survive in a world with new medias and Grant fights for it. Therefore he accepted to write Action Comics and joined Image Revolution. He embraces the new and keeps moving forward, while Moore is a grouch man that lives in the past. [USER] who. Because I have basic reading comprehension skills Ben. Morrison provides direct and provable evidence that Moore is talking smack about him. This is something Padraig should have done if he was doing a journalistic series as he claims to be doing. It is the same thing the NY Times should have done when they let Moore spew atrocious lies about theWatchmen and V for Vendetta movies, so of course I can’t expect better by a fan press reporter. But of course it should still be pointed out as the bullshit it is. [USER] Berger= yeah give me a call pal, let’s discuss the hate. ANYTIME. @ Pessoa: “Moore doesn’t have the same love Morrison has for comics as a media.” I respect both Moore and Morrison as artists, but what is this comment about? Moore always regarded comics as a unique artform, and fought through his work in the 80s for it to be considered equal to other established artforms. (Proof of that can be found by reading most of the interviews conducted with him, and to have a precise quote, you can just watch his video interview for the promotion of Swamp Thing from the 80s, which is uploaded in You Tube ) In addition the entrance fee for his last conference appearance in 2012 was a donation of a graphic novel to the local library, so that they can build a comics section, so it is highly doubtable that he doesn’t love comics as a media, just because he doesn’t adapt to the modern day comics standards. (The recent exploitation of Constantine by DC, certainly doesn’t prove him wrong at all, does it?) [USER] Moore may have fought for comics in the eighties but more than 20 years later he became a grumpy man. He just complain. I didn’t like the way DC treated John Constantine and I will miss the bastard, but comics industry isn’t only DC or Marvel. Currently, we have a vast diversity in comics with Asterios Polyp, 20th Century Boys, The Underwater Welder, The Score, Habibi, Chew, Saga, Blacksad, Journalism etc. However Moore smugly thinks there is no one on his level today. Instead of complaining so much, he should be happy with the quality of several creators working with comics.… Notice how both their names have the letters A,M,O,R in them. What’s that about? Pessoa: “Currently, we have a vast diversity in comics with Asterios Polyp, 20th Century Boys, The Underwater Welder, The Score, Habibi, Chew, Saga, Blacksad, Journalism etc.” I’ve never seen Moore criticize those by name. His diatribes are aimed at a ‘comics industry’ which I think anyone capable of reading between the lines understands means DC and Marvel. “However Moore smugly thinks there is no one on his level today. Instead of complaining so much, he should be happy with the quality of several creators working with comics.” When he made those comments, in reference to DC’s claim that they had chosen its top-flight talent for Before Watchmen, I think he was pretty justified: JMS, Azzarello, Cooke, please… …” You keep saying the times are changing, but I don’t see what that has to do with comics. I don’t know what this ‘new’ is you speak of, but what I see is Morrison revamping decades-old characters like Superman. And that’s a pretty old game in superhero comics. I don’t believe Morrison is part of any solution. If comics are in danger and need saving, that saving is being done by creators who don’t have any emotional attachment for childhood heroes but create their own stories, the way proper writers do. This was great fun to read. I’ve been well aware of the criticisms launched at Mr. Morrison, particularly by Mr. Moorcock, for some time, so it’s a little refreshing to hear the other side of the story. While I love Alan Moore’s work (and Michael Moorcock’s), I’m a Morrison fanboy all the way. He also seems like a really nice guy in real life (never met), just based on other interviews I’ve read or seen. I think Morrison handled this with as much class as someone defending themselves can, really. For the haters, I mean, this is his (Morrison’s) side of the story, so some of it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. But for me, this just adds to my ever growing respect for Morrison as an artist and a human being. Abhay Khosla posts a good response to Morrison here. Scroll down and you’ll see it. “s. k. m. says: Abhay Khosla posts a good response to Morrison here. Scroll down and you’ll see it. A great column! And some things are quite obvious since we can check the FACTS on internet, early interviews and so. ).” And continues… I’m sorry Laura, but you’re not being impartial on this…(as said before) I know you are a huge GM fan, but saying things like: “He’s been quiet while Moore is yelling” is just wrong (from the impartial point of view, just to be clear). Cheers. Robson – nowhere have I claimed to be impartial, in fact my opening paragraphs make clear that I have had very different experiences with both writers which has an impact on my thoughts. What I have said is that one of the Moore fans above was not being impartial either, and indeed, I think that is the main problem all round. It has devolved into “my writer is better than yours!” which is rather absurd. Clearly both writers have contributed a great deal to the medium, which has little to do with how much any one fan may like or dislike them. The tcj has a history of being anti-Morrison, which he is well aware of, and I’m guessing from their patronising tone towards myself that they don’t much like me either. So also impartial, and a little odd coming a clear week later. I would like to thank everyone here at The Beat for the mostly civil discussion – other experiences this week have thrown that into sharp relief. [USER] Fanboys may think the competition is DC vs Marvel, but the game changed. Today comics is competing with videogames, internet, blu-ray etc and many children or teens prefer the new medias. In view of this, comics must adapt to survive. I don’t know what will be the future of comics industry, but I think it will not be as popular as it was. However there are many creators working in comics industry, Grant among them, and they are trying to fortify the media they love. Your antipathy for Morrison is enormous, you ignore he is writing his own stories for Image and Vertigo. Grant has fun writing about heroes. Fun is a high concept Mr. Moore should try some day…lol… Miguel – who started the attacks? You by the looks of it… So much for keeping things civil, eh? Nope. You’ve been calling me by my surname which of course you must know is aggressive, accused me of talking “crap”, and now talk of getting things “in my skull”. I do my best in written discourse to never speak to anyone in a manner I would be unhappy with doing so in person. That also means I see little point in talking to someone who in person I would think rude and snide. I disagree with what you have said, but I disagree with your manner more. Unless the second is rectified – and I can assure you that how you have written your last two comments to me does upset me – I won’t be able to address the former. Just how I roll. Can you be any more of an ass? Miguel, please stop treating Laura like a child. I hope you’re a much more fun and lively person in real life, because you come across as insufferably smug in these comments. Apologies for the double-post, but is Miguel really calling playing videogames the activity of a child? Someone hasn’t played Shadow of the Colossus or Silent Hill 2. No smug doesn’t cover it, Miguel you are rude, hostile and everything wrong with comic fandom. You attacked Laura repeatedly with straw man attacks and rudeness and made so many illogical statements that I hope you were trolling and not really this stupid. Give it a rest a hole. Whoops sorry I took a day off. Miguel you are WAY out of line. It is fine to disagree but the crude, abusive language you are using is unacceptable. Buh bye. didn’t Brendan McCarthy distance himself from Morrison for ripping off Paradax when writing Zenith? I’m pretty sure they are not buddy buddy… and no one gets between me and McCarthy!!!! I like the Filth, I like Animal Man, I like We3 and Invisibles and Flex Mentallo, but Morrison himself, not really. Same with Moore, honestly. I’m not sure I’d like either one in person. Although I end up siding with Moore at the end of the day. Great clear headed thoughts from Julian Darius over at Sequart. “didn’t Brendan McCarthy distance himself from Morrison for ripping off Paradax when writing Zenith?” I think McCarthy designed Zenith. And if he distanced himself, it couldn’t have been over primarily Zenith since Morrison convinced McCarthy to design the Skrull Kill Krew according to Tom Brevoort. An excellent article! I hadn’t read this until Marc-Oliver Frisch linked it in his sales chart column but thank you for exerting all the effort it must’ve taken to put this together. I think Grant Morrison makes many excellent points. I like (and sometimes dislike) both his and Moore’s work but Moore’s increasing negativity seem to border on delusion at times. It’s a pity that Grant will never read this comment, but I’ll try to find some other way of buying him a pint (anywhere in Partick). Pretty strong meat there from Longeur. This is interesting but childish stuff. I love loads of Grant Morrison’s work, loathe some bits and am ambivalent to others. Same with Alan Moore. They’re both innovative and derivative. Moore’s LoEG owes a massive debt to Kim Newman’s Anno Dracula novels particularly the Bloody Red Baron which featured the likes of Mabuse, Caligari, Robur and all manner of pulp characters years before LoEG was published. Likewise, Grant Morrison picking at Moore’s psycho sexual hang ups is a bit rich considering his penchant for transgendered characters. Meta Maid is hardly a sympathetic treatment and the Fanny / Bodie from the Professionals bit in Invisibles is just a grimmer rehash of the TNT Tom / Meta Maid liason at the end of Phase III of Zenith. And I don’t even want to go into Tex Porneau / Spartacus Hughes territory. “And if Moorcock made any complaints to DC in the ’90s, I never heard about them. I had no idea there was any beef with Moorcock until Pop Image’s Jonathan Ellis drew my attention to it in 2004.” – Grant Morrison, quoted above. “He said my work was crass and immature and a disgrace, but, as Mark points out, Michael Moorcock branding your work crass and immature is probably a great compliment! I think he read one issue and has no concept. He’s made a fool of himself because he seems to think that the whole of The Invisibles is based on the Jerry Cornelius concept without having read the rest of what we’ve done.” – Grant Morrison, quoted in SFX (January 1997), pp.39-40. grant BORE-ison and alan BOORE And what about Frank “right minded” Miller, and Neil “”fascist” Gaiman. ROFL Once there was a wizard called Alan. He was the most powerful wizard in the land. And he had two sons, Neil and Grant. He loved Neil more than Grant and gave Neil his secret spell book, so that he might become his heir. But one night, Grant stole his spells for himself, and made himself a powerful wizard in his turn. In time, Grant made his own spells, but Alan always suspected that these spells were in fact spells from his book in disguise. Neil got bored with magic spells and decided to get a proper job instead. The end. This is worth a read again in light of the Jan ’14 Moore interview, I think? -B I’m with ‘Thomas Wayne’, Terry Cantor and Miguel on this one; their comments on Grant Morrison, his career and his antagonistic relationship to Alan Moore have been vigorously expressed in a manner the Grant of old would have heartily approved of, if they were discussing someone else and not Grant himself. The minor differences in age between Moore and Morrison would seem to make them equals in terms of attitude, background and outlook, maybe even politically compatible, but IMHO, Moore seems to be from a completely different generation to Morrison going by the differences in their general tone of their work. Moore’s Captain Britain work with its Jim Jasper’s induced fascist rewiring of British society isn’t so different to the police state V and Evie fight against in V For Vendetta. Moore also produced work for things like Brought To Light and AARGH! in the late 1980s AND refused to work with DC Comics on principal over the ratings controversy, as did Frank Miller, at the same time. Moore also spoke out against Marvel Comics’ treatment of Jack Kirby when Marvel was refusing to acknowledge Kirby’s contribution to creating almost all of the early Marvel Universe characters. I don’t see the same spirit or approach Moore has to his work or public comments in interviews in Morrison’s own output and never have. Or heard or read Grant speaking out against anything at all apart from trivial things such as Neil Gaiman already making a million quid a year by the early 1990s, for example. It’s obvious from Grant’s outpourings that he considers himself a contemporary of, and an also an equal to Alan Moore. I don’t believe he is. Moore’s more personal work reflects a pessimistic outlook on the world in general; V For Vendetta was Moore’s response to the way British society was being affected by Thatcherism. Morrison’s work at the same time as V was serialised in Warrior magazine was the Zoids comic, followed by his absorption by DC Comics in their then UK comics industry sweep for the next Alan Moore. Moore finished off V For Vendetta, his masterpiece, over at DC Comics in the late ’80s as well as Watchmen with Dave Gibbons. Grant was, I believe, starting up on Animal Man. A well regarded strip but no Watchmen. Fandom at this time was also purchasing the new Marvelman/Miracleman stuff from Eclipse Comics, another strip left unfinished with the demise of Warrior magazine. While Morrison is a very prolific, varied and professional writer, the vast majority of his work leaves me cold. I also lost any respect I may have had for him when he shoehorned a Morrissey cameo in Cut magazine’s The New Adventures Of Hitler in 1988. Grant doesn’t mention this strip very often, it seems. I wonder why? Morrison’s an intelligent man but Alan Moore’s intellect is on a another level to Grant’s. In Supergods, Grant admits to using his Doom Patrol and Invisibles stories to actualise his own personal fetishes and desires, presumably being too reticent, withdrawn and afraid to take the plunge in searching out BDSM clubs himself. Moore’s work throughout his career, apart from his Image and ABC stuff, has always had what Morrison abhors – realism, ordinary boring unpleasant grim realism, admittedly seen from the POV of extraordinary characters. Moore’s left superheroes far behind. Grant hasn’t. Why would someone that I recall from an early 00’s Glasgow Herald interview claiming a lack of interest in writing superhero comics because, and I’m quoting from memory here, science is actually on the brink of creating superheroes in laboratories thus making comic books finally redundant? I’m still waiting to see these super humans, Grant – where are they? Moore’ s later work I’m indifferent to. Ditto for Frank Miller. Morrison’s stuff can’t hold a candle to anything Moore and Miller produced in their prime and Grant is resentful of that. Thank you for compiling this thing. There is two sides to every story and then the truth. I think Grant Morrison has put a robust defense here but the chink in the armour is the Moorecock stuff. Are you really saying Grant that you’d let a young writer in the industry essentially mimic or rip parts of you off and just pass it off as a homage and you’d be cool with it? Are you really going to give that the greenlight or be a grumpy old man in a few years like Moore? Seems you have put yourself on a bit of tightrope there. Moore vs Morrison is akin to Stephen Fry attempting to annoy Irving Welsh, a pointless task that has only served to illuminate Moore’s obsession with Morrison while failing woefully to establish anything like the converse, an allegation he doesn’t even manage to make convincingly never mind present evidence for. A lot of people are unwilling to take sides on the dispute because they value both writers but I’m prepared to say that Morrison’s movements in the 90’s were forward whereas Moore’s have been consistently backwards towards the Dickensian era he now inhabits as only a curmudgeon can. Bring on Morrison’s divorce and rebirth upon the world stage as a provocateur because if an old tight beardy is all we’ve got as a legacy (other than the Time Warner mack) then our sentence is definitely not up. *Time Warner mask I love this feud. Especially that it’s been going on for so long. Part of me hopes that these two brilliant minds are working together to create this plot beyond their convention… It wouldn’t be unimaginable, or uncommon for either, that they would hatch a plot that begins with comics and extends into reality. Of course it’s probably a sad argument, one that we have very little business being a part of, fueled by spite, misunderstanding and perhaps some chest beating. I love both of their work and hope that this is play, an expansion of their universes into ours, to influence and play with our lives. The story of them making this story would be far more heart warming than the reality these interviews suggest. Either way, bravo to both and look forward to reading more.</td>\n",

Fall 200S our unpversi Much of this issue of Shafer Court Connections is devoted to commemorating the birth 4-0 years ago of Virginia Commonweahh University. VCU is marking its anniversary with a variety of opportunities for alumni to share in commemo- rative and celebratory activities and programs. I hope you will capitalize on this special time in our history to make a new connection — or strengthen your existing bond — with your university. I urge you to visit the \"Fortieth and Foi^ward\" anniversary Web site at, where you can revisit VCU's history and share your own memories in a virtual time capsule. You also can be a part of this historic celebration by joining VCU and the Richmond community at the Monroe Park Festival, which kicks off at noon Saturday. Oct. 25. in Monroe Park. The festival will feature the best of VCU today and yesterday as well as musical performances from local bands nominated by students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends. Rumor has it that the infamous \"Ask It\" booth and other alumni favorites might re-emerge for this special celebration. As always, your alumni magazine showcases graduates, students, faculty and staff who represent the cherished values that reflect the intellectual excellence of your university. I hope you will pay close attention to an article explaining the increasingly critical role private support from alumni and friends plays in the future of your alma mater, as public funding for higher education continues to decline. I've heard it said that VCU has evolved from a state-supported to a state-assisted university, and now we find ourselves most accurately described as state-located. Our future margin of excellence rests in the hands of our alumni and friends. Anniversaries and birthdays mark significant milestones and accomplishments while providing the opportunity for reflection, celebration and renewed commitment, enthusiasm and energy to achieve our mission, shared vision and goals. This year presents an opportunity to celebrate the milestones and accomplishments of VCU across the past 40 years while looking ahead to the exciting prospects for future collaborations and discoveries. I encourage you to reflect on the role VCU has played — and continues to play — in your life and to take this opportunity to get involved- Your university will be enriched by your participation and leadership. According to your fellow alumni who have joined the VCU Alumni Association as active dues-paying members, the benefits and enrichment go both ways.

Dr. Irani signs national green compact In April. VCU President Eugene P. Trani. Ph.D.. signed a national compact among col- lege presidents to address global warming by working to neutralize greenhouse gas emis- sions on campuses. The American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment represents an initiative to reduce the global emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by midcentury. Earlier this year. VCU's Student Government Association urged university administrators to seek ways for VCU to embrace sustainability in design and stewardship. \"This type of formal compact highlights VCU's commitment to work with universities across the country to demonstrate leadership in the community by modeling ways to minimize emissions that contribute to global warming.\" Dr. Trani says. In addition to efforts already in place across VCU's campuses to conserve energy and reduce emissions, VCU is constructing several build- ings to LEED standards, the nationally accepted benchmark for optimal energy and environ- mental design and construction. VCU, W&amp;M partner on health policy VCU and the College of William and Mary have formed a signature collaboration to address health policy. The VCU-William and Mary Health Policy and Law Initiative will bring together faculty and students from VCU's L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, the VCU School of Medicine and the William and Mary Law School to conduct research and provide public service. The initiative's first service-learning project, set for January 2OO9. is a Veterans Disability Clinic. Future plans include offering joint degree programs that focus on solving topical problems in health policy, law and bioethics. 6 I VCU Shafer Court Connections Research repor; Barnes &amp; Noble @ VCU flags fly outside the Monroe Park Campus bookstore.

Grad earns Fulbright Scholarship Jessica Langley (M.F.A.'o8/A) has earned a Fulbright Student Scholarship to study and pur- sue her artistic interests in Iceland. Langley will travel to Iceland for the 2008-09 academic year to study the country's landscape and to create art inspiredby her surroundings. Upon her return to the U.S., Langley hopes to increase the exchange between Icelandic and American artists. Langley is the fourth VCU student to receive a Fulbright Scholarship in the past three years. Partnership aids ASD instruction VCU and 15 public school divisions in Central Virginia have formed a partnership that will provide training and professional development for teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders. The Region I Autism Education Consortium will provide educational opportunities to benefit nearly I.OOO children with ASD. The consortium also plans to create a structure for schools to access staff development resources, implement research-based practices and methodologies, and enhance and build parent partnerships. entifies gene with possible schizophrenia VCU researchers have identified a gene associated with schizophrenia that could provide further insight about the pathophysiology of the disease. Led by Xiangning Chen, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and human genetics in VCU's School of Medicine, and Kenneth S. Kendler, M.D., professor of psychiatry and human genetics in VCU's School of Medicine, the research team studied variants of the gene, MEGFlO, in affected and unaffected individuals from Ireland and Northern Ireland. Supported in part by the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, the team found that some variants of MEGFlO had a higher frequency in schizophrenia patients than in healthy controls, and these variants were associated with higher expression of the gene in the brain of affected subjects. This \"provides evidence that a gene directly involved in apoptosis, or cell death, is associated with schizophrenia,\" Chen says. \"Apoptosis has long been speculated to be involved in schizophrenia, but no gene directly involved in this process was found to be associated with the disease.\" Anti-cancer drug combination induces cell death in CML VCU Massey Cancer Center researchers have discovered that a combination of anti- cancer compounds kills chronic myelogenous leukemia cells previously resistant to conventional forms of therapy. Imatinib mesylate inhibits the activity of a mutant protein, known as Bcr/AbI, which is responsible for CML; however, patients eventually become resistant to imatinib mesylate, often through the development of further mutations in the Bcr/AbI protein. According to Steven Grant, M.D., Massey's associate director for translational research, and co-leader of the cancer center's Cancer Cell Biology Program and senior author of the study, resistance to imatinib mesylate prompted the search for newer agents. Working under grants from the National Institutes of Health, the V Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America, and the Department of Defense, Grant and colleagues examined the effects of combining MK-0457, a Bcr/AbI kinase inhibitor, with vorinostat, a drug recently approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. They found that this combination leads to a dramatic induction of programmed cell death in CML cells, including imatinib-resistant cells. Preclinical studies are under way to test whether it may be possible to develop a clinical regimen based on these findings. Trend in waterpipe smoking signals future health problem More U.S. college students are smoking tobacco using waterpipes, or hookahs, and it's becoming a growing public health issue, according to a new study led by Thomas Eissenberg, Ph.D., associate professor in the VCU Department of Psychology. Under grants from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute on Dru Abuse and the Fogarty International Center, Eissenberg and his research team con- ducted a cross-sectional study of approximately 744 students, mostly between the ages of 18 and 21. Approximately 43 percent of those surveyed had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past year; and 20 percent of them had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past month. In addition, users were more likely to perceive waterpipes as less harmful than cigarettes compared to those who had never used a waterpipe before. According to Eissenberg, current and prospective waterpipe tobacco smokers should be made aware that waterpipe tobacco smoking is not as benign as they might think. Waterpipe smoke and cigarette smoke contain some of the same toxins — disease- causing tar and carbon monoxide, as well as dependence-producing nicotine. mBf^j^ ' w'S^ ''Stt. Fortieth and forward Virginia Commonwealth University celebrates its first 40 years with an eye toward the future The ^Oth anniversary of Virginia Gonunonwealth University revisits a historic moment in higher education, when in ig68 the General Assembly established an urban university in the heart of Richmond. With more than 32,000 students, VGU today represents the state's largest pubhc university and embodies academic and research excellence indelibly tied to the histories of its founding institutions — the Medical GoUege of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute. This year, the university celebrates the important milestones that have helped shape VGU and the vision for tom^orrow's possibilities. ■MibsJ^ m Virginia Commonwealth University's legacy continues in the tradition of two celebrated institution^ •* \"\"-^ '-«:-:*»:* \"■'^i'':- - l\"^^i/4*i^ IHi^ll r /CU Shafer Court Connections «i®gas^i „, _gNi_. ,_. ^ _. «' orty years ago, Virginia General Assembly enacted a bold concept vhen it used the infrastructure of two separate institutions, amedica college and an entrepreneurial pro- fessional institute, to create Virginia Commonwealth University. The founders involved in the university's creation might not recognize the current VCU — one of the top research universities in the country. Their underlying vision of this urban university, however, remains. VCU's story begins in the early 1960s when sup- port increased for Richmond Professional Institute to become a full-fledged university. In 1965 RPI e.-peri- enced the largest enrollment increase in its histoiy. That same year, the Higher Education Study ComiTiission, chaired by state Sen. Lloyd C. Bird, concluded that the Richmond area needed a \"bold, new development,\" in other words, a major university. The Bird Commission recommended combining two existing institutions, RPI and the Medical College of Virginia, to create this uni- versity. The rationale behind the proposed union was that the two schools would be a formidable combination, stronger together than each was on its own. The idea of pooling the resources of MCV and RPI made sense and, to many people, seemed like a natu- ral fit. At the time of the commission's report, the two schools already intersected in many areas. RPI's public health program had been using MCV facilities and fac- ulty since its inception. Plus, a number of cooperative programs existed between the two institutions, includ- ing a joint doctorate in clinical psychology. By the 1960s, MCVstudents were taking English, history, statistics and economics courses at RPI or with RPI instructors who worked as adjunct faculty at the medical school. Following the Bird Commission's report findings, the 1966 General Assembly formed another group to go forward with a plan for the state university. Edward A. Wayne Sr., president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, chaired the commission. Wayne's vision for the school took the Bird Commission's recommendation a step further. He proposed not a merger of RPI and MCV. but instead the creation of a completely new entity with the two schools as its components. The commission's report was unanimous and recom- mended the establishment, effective July I. 1968, of \"an urban-oriented state university in Richinond to embrace and build upon the Medical College of Virginia and the Richmond Professional Institute.\" Members of the commission contended that \"an urban-oriented university is unique in that its basic phi- losophy concentrates on meeting the needs of an urban population living and working in an urban environ- ment. \"The city is truly its living laboratory. \" The commission's recommendation, supported by the governor and the General Assembly, created VCU. After considering other sites for the university, including locations in Henrico, Chesterfield and Hanover coun- ties, the report recommended that the existing location realized the \"\"urban university \" concept. Any initial concerns about the creation of VCU less- ened over the years as the university took shape. Each of the university s four presidents — Warren W, Brandt, Ph.D., T. Edward Temple, Ph.D., Edmund F. AckeD, M.D., D.M.D., and Eugene P. Trani. Ph.D. - built on the work and vision of his predecessor to fulfill the university's mission of teaching, research, public service and patient care. The original concept that emerged from the Bird and Wayne commissions of an urban university using the city as its laboratory continues to resonate today as students on the MCV Campus and Monroe Park Campus engage in these areas under one very expansive roof. Today. VCU stands as the largest public university in the state, tripling its student body to more than 32. GOO, and ranks among the top lOO universities in the country in sponsored research. To commemorate the university's anniversary and acknowledge its tremendous growth in such a short time, a Virginia Senate Joint Resolution introduced by state Sen. Donald McEachin designated July I, 2008, as VCU Day. The resolution recognizes VCU \"as a leader in teaching, research, public service and patient care for the city of Richmond, the common- wealth of Virginia and the United States. \" As VCU looks toward the ne.xt 40 years and beyond, the university takes pride in the rich history and accom- plishments of MCV and RPI. Through the blending of campuses, faculties, staffs and academic programs, VCU embodies the vision of those who believed in a strong single institution shaped by a common mission and shared goals.

Mills E. Godwin Jr.'s 1968 legislation that created Virginia Commonwealth University, the new entity fashioned from the Medical College of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute began to forge its own identity. Forty years ago, VCU's footprint encompassed approximately IIO acres and the student body totaled I0,000. Today, its size exceeds 140 acres and 32,000 students. \"VCU had none of the physical pres- ence nor the stature that it does today, \" says Hugh Keogh (M.S. '81/MC), president of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, \"but it was impeccable at catering to the needs of the full-time professional.\" Like many VCU stu- dents then, Keogh worked during the day and took classes at night. A more mature student body was the norm at that time. \"The movement in Virginia toward everybody get- ting a higher education was on,\" says Ed Peeples Jr., Ph.D., (B.S. 57/E). VCU associate professor emeritus of preventive medicine and community health, \"so people were showing up at the door.\" 12 I VCU Shafer Court Connections The Academic Division of the University — later called the Academic Campus and now known as the Monroe Park Campus encompassed a handful of buildings, many of them historic landmarks, within a few-block radius. \"It was just a small, cobble- stone campus back in those days . ' says Ken Magill, Ed.D., (B.S. '65/B; M.S. 'Gg/E), retired associate professor in the VCU School of Education. The Elealth Sciences Division — now known as the MCV Campus — was equally compact, sitting in a square between Broad and Leigh streets. Many of the instructors were local physicians who taught as adjunct faculty in whatever rooms were available. \"The MCV Campus was very much a town medical school.\" Peeples remembers. Facilities did not immediately improve with the stroke of Godwin's pen. Witnesses to VCU's emer- gence from its two parent institutions, however, recall it as an exciting time. \"In the early days of VCU, it was a kind of a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland kind of school,\" says Lester Van Winkle, professor emeritus in the School of the Arts, who joined VCLf in 1968. \"It was like, \"eah. we've got an old building over here and we've got some students. We'll make some classrooms. ' There was that sort of flavor to the school. \" The vital faculty and engaged students enlivened the place, but space was certainly at a premium in those early days. The Anderson Building, home to the current Anderson Gallery, was the de facto library. Needless to say. the site was inadequate even though the volume of titles and journals was expo- nentially fewer than the number VCU has today. Ul^. \"The Department ot Histor)' had about six or eight cardboard boxes of books on the third floor of that building and that was the com- plete histoi'y holding. \" says William Blake Jr., Ph.D., a professor of history since 1965, at RPI, then at VCU. \"Now, we've got thousands of history books. We went from a few hundred books to literally thousands and thousands of history volumes. \" Peeples remembers teaching in the Anderson Building among the piles, giving new meaning to library \"stacks. \" \"The books were all over the floor, \" he says. \"If somebody tipped them over, they would never find what they were looking for.\" At this time of transition, VCU used the resources available to accommodate students and faculty while working out its growing pains. As Keogh says, VCL^ was still clearly emerging and beginning \"to flex itself a little bit as an attractive option for higher education in Virginia. \" 4 Fall 2008 j 1 sr % THE BRANDT STAMP With the naming of Warren W. Brandt, Ph.D., as VCU's first president, the wheels began moving to mold the university into a place where students could earn a top-notch education in a stimulating and comfortable environment. Brandt also had the very difficult job of uniting the two administrations — each with its different facilities, processes and rules — into one cohesive unit. Combining the two previous insti- tutions was not an easy sell at first, says Blake, who as the first president of the ^^ — * \"^ VCU Faculty Senate helped bridge the ^^^V ^B gap between the two campuses. It was a ^K pH bit of a challenge, he says, \"because the ^Jmy' -^^^tk people at MCV had a long tradition.\" 4MBJPUMP|H|M John Borgard, Ph.D., associate dean of undergraduate academic affairs from 1999 to 2004, first came to VCU in 1971. He says RPI traditions fueled corresponding feelings on the Academic Campus, with some faculty resisting change. \"A lot of people wanted the university to continue to be an RPI atmosphere because it was kind of an 'in' atmosphere and to go big would not be true to the beginnings of this school.\" - John Borgard, Ph.D.. former associate dean of undergraduate acac/emic affairs \"A lot of people wanted the university to continue to be an RPI atmosphere because it was kind of an in atmo- sphere and to go big would not be true to the beginnings of this school.\" Slowly, faculty members became energized by the direction the university and Brandt were headed. He had definite ideas of how to enhance the student experience and pushed for summer orientation programming in which each freshman student talked with an adviser for 30 minutes. \"It was something that Brandt talked about and we said. That's a good idea, \" says Borgard. It was a big part of getting students off to a good start.\" During Brandt's administration, VCU became Virginia's largest university with 17,000 students. The university responded to the demand by adding 32 new degree programs and the schools of Allied Health Professions and Community Service. Just as important, the construction and acquisition of numerous build- ings strengthened the university's infrastructure in order to emphasize Brandt's vision for expansion of research opportunities, programs and schools to come. The structures built or acquired during Brandt's ten- ure included the James Branch Cabell Library (just the first floor; the other three would be built in 1975)' Rhoads Hall and the School of Business building on the Academic Campus, and an addition to the TDmpkins-McCaw Library and expansion to Sanger Hall on the medical campus. Despite the flurry of building, the campus still felt spread out, \"When I arrived, I was really kind of unsure about where VCU was, \" says Greg Wingfield (B.S. '74/H&amp;S M.U.R.R '76/H&amp;S), president and CEO of the Greater Richmond Partnership. \"It wasn't like you walked through the gates and said, 'Here I am.' VCU was here, there and evei-ywhere. \" Students had no real gathering place. The University Student Commons did not exist; it would not be built for another decade. Students soon discovered the Shafer Court corridor and it became the unofficial hangout. \"That was kind of ground zero for student life back then,\" Wingfield says. Marsha Shuler (B.S. '74/B), senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, recalls having her business classes in various old buildings on Franklin Street. Wlien the School of Business building was finished in 1972 \"that made a huge difference as far as students get- ting to know one another and having die capability to study together, \" she says. Brandt's tireless efforts to establish VCU as a university of high academic standing ended with his retirement in 1974 and laid the gi-oundwork for his successor. A BRIEF REIGN Inaugurated in 1975' VCU's second president, T. Edward Temple, Ph.D., died after only 21 months in office. Still, he managed to create a lasting leg- acy. As president, he revamped VCU's administrative structure and developed a \"traveling road show \" to showcase the university to the public. \"He had a magic with people, ' Peeples notes. \"He served the great purpose of legitimizing VCU among state people.\" Temple also campaigned for a new hospital on the medical campus, which improved relations between the two campuses. \"He would take in people s opin- ions and he'd put them to work.\" Peeples says. \"But Ed Temple added a social-psychological dimension that was so necessary and he underscored the urban mis- sion and the service side of things.\" After H.I. Willett served as interim president for one year, Edmund E. Ackell, M.D., D.M.D.. becaine VCU's third leader. A former dentistry professor and the vice pi-esident for health affairs and special assistant for governmental affairs at the University of Southern California, Ackell further united and expanded the two campuses. A BUILDING BOOM Ackell's 12 -year tenure marked the beginning of a period of inajor develop- ment for the university. VCU experienced its larg- est growth spurt up to that time, with a budget that ballooned from $135 niillion to $43^ million. The student population topped 20,000, so one of Ackell's main focuses was additional construction. During this stint, a new hospital, a cancer center (now the Massey Cancer Center), a student commons, a performing- arts center, a pharmacy building, a residence hall, athletic facilities and two parking decks added to the growing campus footprint. With the addition of the first phase of Gladding Residence Center, completed in 1979' VCU moved from strictly a commuter school to a more traditional university where students lived on campus. \"Students now had a chance to engage themselves on the campus in ways that they didn't in the 1970s and before that,\" Borgard remembers. As more students remained on campus, VCU branched into the safety business. \"VCU really was on \"The obvious change is the diversity. Where it was a black-and-white campus 30 years ago, it's now international. It mirrors society today.' - Jerry Wittiams (B.F.A. '71/A), writer, director and producer of commercials and videos the cutting edge of that. \" Borgard says. \"The univer- sity was doing card swipes to get into dorms and having 24/7 presence at the front door before lots of colleges and universities. \" At the same time, VCU's commitment to education continued as increased numbers of community college and transfer students found a home at the university. The university's population gi'adually shifted from mature working adults to more full-time coUege-age students. However, VCU still offered nontraditional students a place to earn an e.xemplai-)' higher education and created innovative new degree programs to suit them. Gale Crowder (B.G.S. '86/H&amp;S), who volun- teers in the Richmond arts community, earned a Bachelor of General Studies — now called a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies — after a 25~year hiatus in her education. \"It was a vei-y unique program origi- nally set up for older people who had some college or university but who hadn't finished. \" she says. While Crowder was nervous about returning to school, she felt welcome at VCU. In fact, she was often recognized around town. \"Never did it dawn on me that I stuck out, \" she says. \"One day 1 thought. \"I guess that's how they know me because 1 don't look like everyone else. \" VCU was and still is known for the individuality of its students. \"It used to be it was long hair and then it was piercings and now it's tattoos, but you still see the same kind of kids,\" says Jerry Williams (B.E.A. '71/A), a writer, director and producer of coinmer- cials and videos. \"The obvious change is the diversity. Where it was a black-and-white campus 30 years ago, it's now international. It mirrors society today. \" Fall 2008 i 15 Sit r Ht »* WHAT'S UN IHhr^ Wall &lt; ii. ^ r / f i^i^Jii-r^f^n / d^^HiB^^^^^^^I^^^H ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^HIPB9I I^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B^^^^^^Sj X&gt; A&gt;ffjj^^^^^^&gt;JJJJ S^^ li ^ L^ ,-lft ,:d£«- '^ *\" Think you know VCU's history?

You really don't think of one without the other.\" - David Batdacci (B.A. '85/I-I&amp;S). best-selling author and VCU Board of Visitors member A 21st-century university By 1990, VCU ranked 64th among the top lOO federally funded research institutions. When Eugene P. Trani, Ph.D., became VCU s fourth president, he built on Ackell's vision and prepared the university to enter the 2Ist century with explosive growth in the areas of community outreach, research opportunities, and services and resources for students. \"The expansion of buildings and programs has allowed for a lot more diversity at VCU and has set the foundation for us to be a true player for years to come in so many different arenas.\" says Nina Sims (B.S. (j'^/MC), director of marketing and sales for the Community College Workforce Alliance. With a student body of 2I.OOO. more than double the size of what it was at the university's beginning, VCU needed room to expand. President Trani looked north toward Broad Street, which largely consisted of abandoned warehouses and storefronts. The $105 million investment into renovating the area, including building residence halls, a sports arena, a bookstore and an arts building, spurred more than $IOO million in private investment by developers. \"That's just a perfect example of where growth needs to occur to accommodate the university in an area that needed revitalization,\" says the Greater Richmond Partnership's Wingfield. \"It was a marriage that was a win-win on both sides.' VCU's development north included the creation of the Carver-VCU Partnership, a joint venture to build a safe and nurturing environment for those in the neigh- boring Cai-ver community. The VCU Police increased patrols while working with residents, and VCU students began mentoring the community's children. At the same time, four new residence halls, as well as expansion to the University Student Commons, allowed VCU to offer its students a more complete col- lege ex-perience. As an undergraduate living in Rhoads Hall and then Gladding Residence Center, Michelle Ferrera (M.S. 'Ol/AHP) appreciated what life in the residence halls had to offer. On the weekends, the university scheduled programs and events to keep stu- dents engaged, \"The university made the effort to give students a true campus feel, \" Ferrera says. Tlie continued gi'ovrth, recognition and sense of pur- pose created a feeling of pride across the university. \" It was the first time 1 felt there was a sense of shared aspirations, \" professor emeritus Van Winkle says. \"Suddenly, everybody had a very positive attitude about the place. People telt there was acknowledgment of successes, \" A TURNING POINT But \"the watershed moment \" for VCU, Keogh of the Virginia Chainber of Commerce says, occurred in 1995 with the establishment of the School of Engineering. \"TTiat was a veiy important public-private partnership between the commonwealth, the university and the business community, \" he says. \"The area begged for [an engineer- ing school] and they said they'd do it and they did it.\" Uniquely designed with a biomedical focus tied to the biotechnology and industrial needs of the Richmond region, the engineering school — a key component of President Trani's vision for VCU — followed on the heels of another economic endeavor.

The opening in 1995 of the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park, a partnership between VCU, the city of Richmond and the state, expanded the university's research possibilities and provided a catalyst for increased collaboration and economic development. Situated on 34 acres adjacent to the VCU Medical Center, the BioTech Park serves as the state's only science park dedi- cated exclusively to the advancement of biosciences. VCU soon began to place a stronger einphasis on this burgeoning area, and in 2000, launched a university- wide life sciences initiative that combined the resources and interests of the two campuses. \"Gene Trani has always said the past two centuries have been chemistry and physics and the 2 1st century is the century of life sciences,\" says Leonard Smock, Ph.D., VCU professor since 1979 ^i^d chairman of the Department of Biology since I990- With the creation of VCU Life Sciences, the link between the science departments and the MCV Campus strengthened. Additional facilities, such as the VCU Inger and Walter Rice Center for Environmental Life Sciences — a 342-acre living laboratory on the James River in Charles City County — offer even more chances for partnerships. Back in the city, the collocation of the schools of Business and Engineering exemplifies VCU's vision for increased collaboration among disciplines. A major component of VCU's largest capital campaign, which raised more than $410 million from 1999 'o 20o8, the Il-acre Monroe Park Campus Addition includes Snead Hall, home to the School of Business, and East Hall, the second building for the School of Engineering, joined by a student commons and shared facilities. THE NEXT CHAPTER The expansion of VCU's campuses has not only improved the university, but it also has sparked a surge in economic development in the city from the Fan to downtown. \"VCU has been the driving force, \" says David Baldacci (B.A. 'Ss/H&amp;S), best-selling author and VCU Board of Visitors member. '1 tend to think of VCU and Richmond as sort of one entity now. You really don't think of one without the other. \" After 40 years of sustained growth, VCU contin- ues to move forward, at home and abroad. Today, VCU maintains partnerships with 16 international universities, including the VCU School of the Arts in Qatar. Additionally, the university opened campuses in Northern Virginia for the schools of Medicine. Pharmacy and Social Work and plans to further expand its mission locally, regionally and globally. \"I think we will continue to see a real strengthening of our research capabilities, our scholarly productivity,\" Smock says. We will continue to attract more and more of the top students and it will continue to get harder and harder to get into VCU.\" Additional growth vnW come, and as many of VCU's administrators, faculty and alumni know, evolution can happen quickly, spur change and lead to greatness. \"The last time I was at VCU, I noticed a lot of banners up, Ferrera says. \"1 thought, \"Wow! VCLl seems to be veiy proud.' The colors are showing. The banners are flying. Today when kids see all of the state-of-the-art facilities, that bodes well for the school.\" Enn Egan is a contnbuting writer Jor Shafer Court Connections. 18 I VCU Shafer Court Connections m^'- 1 .X^sdMH^fery marKS the donation of its namesake c5l ^ay Bonis Above, from left: Francii president. Margaret Freem Cabell and Maurice Duke- rendering of the proposed Tames Branch Cabe!! Librar The April 26, 1968, issue of Richmond Professional Institute's student newspaper, Prescript, announced plans to name the new Virginia Commonwealth University library after famed Richmond author James Branch Cabell. The reclusive writer gained national atten- tion in the 1920s after New York state attempted to suppress the publication of his romantic fantasy, \"Jurgen,\" on grounds that it was pornographic. A renewed interest in Cabell's writing 1 surfaced in the late 1960s - a decade after his death - just as plans for the new library were under way. In January 1967, Edgar MacDonald, Ph.D., (B.S. '52/H&amp;S), an English profes- sor at Randoiph-Macon College, spoke I at the Woman's Club of Richmond ^ about Cabell's relevance to the city. E. Allan Brown, Ph.D., (1919-1985), chair of RPI's English department, attended the lecture and walked away with the idea to name the new library after Cabell. 'Allan was concerned that the proposed univer- sity or the new library might be named after Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr. or some other politician,\" says MacDonald, author of \"James Branch Cabell and Richmond-In-Virginia.\" That same year, RPI English professor Maurice Duke, Ph.D., began compiling a catalog of Cabell's 3,000-volume personal library for his dissertation. \"I personally handled and described every book in the collection,\" says Duke, now professor emeritus of English at VCU. \"I did all the work after meeting with classes each day i typed the whole [catalog] on the black marble-top table using Cabell's ancient type- writer, both of which are now in the Cabell Room\" on the library's fourth floor. Duke and MacDonald overwhelmingly supported Brown's naming campaign and so did RPI's Board of Visitors. \"Cabell would have been childishly delighted with the idea of a library named after him,\" MacDonald says. \"It would have meant a type of acceptance from Richmond that he didn't receive when he was alive.\" In the wake of the board's decision, Margaret Freeman Cabell, James Branch Cabell's second wife, donated the library's first collection — Cabell's exten- sive library, which includes F. Scott Fitzgerald first editions signed by the author and early editions of Mark Twain's work. In 1975, the collection and the Cabell Room opened to the university community along with the library's top three floors; the first floor opened in 1970. At the library's formal dedication, in 1976, then VCU President T Edward Temple, Ph.D., com- mented on the tremendous role libraries play in academic life: \"Without a library, there is indeed no university.\" Ray Bonis (B.S.

Fall 20p84 S^'TLmSS—: Annual gifts replenish the resources needed to offer education at an affordable cost When Debby Engelbrecht MacArthur (B.F.A. '72/A), a Connecticut-based jewelry designer, visited Richmond. Va.. recently, the Floyd Avenue apartment she called home during college looked exactly the same. But her alma mater sure didn't. \"The school looks wonderful, \" she says. \"1 couldn't believe how much it has expanded. \" In the 36 years since MacArthur grad- uated, Virginia Commonwealth University has undergone a major evolution. In 1968, the General Assembly fashioned VCU from the Medical College of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute. At that time, the state-supported university offered lO.OOO students approximately 80 degree programs in 13 schools and two departments. Today, VCU enrolls more than 32,000 students in 205 certificate and degree programs in the arts, sciences and humanities. Sixty-five of the programs are unique in Virginia, many of them crossing the disciplines of VCU's 15 schools and one college. In addition, new buildings have sprouted up throughout the city and others have undergone significant renovations, dras- tically changing the landscape of VCU's campuses. As VCU has transformed, support from the commonwealth of Virginia has not kept pace, echoing a growing trend in higher education across the nation, says Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Stephen D, Gottfredson, Ph.D. 'When I began my career as a university educator, about 75 percent of any public university's budget came from its state's gen- eral fund, and about 25 percent came from all other sources. And by all other sources — I mean tuition and fees, I mean private gifts and endowments and I mean federal, state or industry grants and contracts for research and services,\" he says. \"Today, 30 years later, that picture is just about reversed: about 25 percent of a major public university's bud- get comes froiTi its state's general fund, and about 75 percent comes from those other sources,\" That's where alumni such as MacArthur help make a difference. For more than 20 years, MacArthur has made annual gifts of unrestricted dollars to the VCU School of the Arts. Now in a finan- cial position to give back, she says she sees it as an important responsibility. I read a lot, and I know schools cannot survive on tuition and state support alone, \" she says. Unrestricted annual gifts support the most-pressing initiatives at a certain time, such as student scholarships, improvements in clinical and classroom facilities, faculty support, technology advancements and more. Retired SunTrust executive Bill Ginther (B.S. '69/B; M.S. '74/B) reiterates the importance of annual giving in bridging the gap between the priorities funded by the state and the hopes and dreams of the university. \"VCU is state-supported, which means its budget is affected by the economy,\" he says, \"With the state budget, a lot of institutions are vying for the same dollars. As VCU con- tinues on its upward trajectory in terms of education, it just can't make many inroads relying on an ever-fluctuating state budget. \" Likewise, Gottfredson points out that families are being asked to foot more and more of the bill for higher education while students are having a tougher time borrow- ing money. \"Students from less affluent families are having a harder time attending college. \" he says. \"The average student leaving VCU today with an undergraduate degree takes with her an educational debt of more than $20,000. And the problem is only going to get worse. \" Ginther thinks it is time for more alumni to step up to the plate. There were people who were giving to VCU when was a student and providing for me. It is now my responsibility to provide. - Bill Ginther (B.S. '69/B: M.S. '74/B} 1 jg \"I have the belief that there were people who were giving to VCU when I was a student and providing for me, \" he says. \"It is now my responsibility to provide. \" U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings heav- ily emphasize the percentage of alumni who give, says Ginther, a ineinber of the School of Business Foundation board of trustees. According to Ginther, VCU's record falls below other universities of its stature. \"If we could get a donation from every graduate.\" he says, \"we'd be in great shape.\" Melanie Irvm Solaimani (B.S.

If you've walked along or driven down the 900 block of West Franklin Street, just before you get to Shafer Street, on the right, you may have noticed a 14-foot-tall tower of brownstone-colored discs. \"Tableith,\" the first sculpture erected on the Monroe Park Campus in recognition of VCU's history, tells the story of Richmond Professional Institute, but the culmination of the project has an interesting story all of its own. Three years ago, a group of alumni, meeting to plan a larger-than-usual annual reunion, decided to recognize the begin- nings of RPI and its founder, Henry Hibbs, Ph.D. Established in 1917 — just before America entered World War I — to edu- cate social workers and public health nurses, RPI remained under Hibbs' lead- ership until the establishment of Virginia Commonwealth University in 1968. With a campus location for the commemora- tive sculpture provided by the university, the RPI alumni group established a com- mittee to plan a fundraising campaign, invite submissions from artists, and then judge and ultimately select the winning entrant. Today, 'Tableith,\" created by Richmond sculptor Charles Ponticello (M.F.A. '94/A), stands majestically between the historic Ginter House — or the \"Ad Building,\" short for the Administration Building — and the Scott House awaiting its formal dedication in October, during the celebration of VCU's 40th anniversary. Weighing more than 20 tons, \"Tableith\" consists of 51 cast discs representing RPI's growth from 1917 until the founding of VCU in 1968. Each disc represents a year in the life of RPI and features an inscription along the edge with a key event from that year. \"The solidarity and power of monolithic structures inscribed with information have been burned into our minds for centuries,\" Ponticello says. \"The marriage of object and text provides viewers a new and enlightening perspective of RPI. Viewers will experience a spiral tapestry that narrates the historical past of VCU. As the discs build upon one another, they merge and mesh into a strong, interlocking structure, symbolic of harmony, synchronicity and change.\" The final phase of the project will be a cobblestone terrace and landscaping around \"Tableith,\" utilizing the 300 origi- nal cobblestones saved from the repaving of the alley that led to the old library, now Anderson Gallery. All RPI alumni and friends, as well as VCU staff, faculty, students, parents and others are invited to attend the RPI Commemorative Sculpture Presentation on Saturday, Oct. 25, or view online at.

Fall 2008 I 2:^ Alumni benefit from reinvesting in their alma mater I Vine bacK what is the secret to making a gift to Virginia Commonwealth University that holds meaning for you and makes a lasting impact? A bequest. \"Bequests are a great way to ensure future excellence at VCU,\" says Tom Burke, executive director of the VCU Foundation. Because the needs of students and the university change each year, the unrestricted funds generated from bequests give the presi- dent flexibility to respond to the most pressing needs of the moment, Burke says. \"We are glad to be 'last in line' and are always thankful to be included in an alumnus's will or even considered for a bequest,\" he says. James Lester: Embracing opportunity Joseph Holicky III: Supporting student scholarship James Lester (B.S. '62/B), a former president of the RPI A three-degree alumnus of VCU and longtime state employee. Alumni Association, likes to stay involved with his alma mater Joseph Holicky III (B.S. '76/B; B.S. '77/HS,S; M.S. '78/B) recog- because engagement helps keep him sharp \"At 73' ^ \"^ very interested in staying mentally active. The more 1 stay involved, the more I learn and the better I am,\" he says. One way he has stayed connected is through the VCU Heritage Society. He and his wife, Faye. gained membership to this group by including VCU in their estate plan. The society offers mem- bers special opportunities for attending lectures, performances and other events. \"Planned giving allows you to determine what you would like the gift to support and lets you meet with your advisers to determine the most effective giving method for ta.x purposes,\" Lester says. \"This was the most efficient tax venue for our charitable giving and gives us flexibility during our lifetime.\" James Lester nizes the skyrocketing costs of education. \"The cost of education is in the strato- sphere,\" he says. \"There is no good or easy answer to making college education more affordable.\" To help make a difference for students, he and his wife, Irene Burlock, have established endowed scholarships in the schools of Business and Engineering. But they want to do more and plan to include VCU in their wills. Joseph Holicky III ,,-,., 1 , i 1 ■ 1 With scholarships, we can see the immediate impact and interact with our recipients,\" Holicky says. He says he hopes his planned gift, however, will continue to provide benefits to the university long after he's gone. \"The school has gone in unbelievable directions, \" he says. \"I'm proud to be part of the evolution.\" If you are interested in learning more about planned giving strategies and the benefits they can offer, contact Tom Burke, executive director of the VCU Foundation, at (804) 828-3958 or tcburke[USER].edu, or visit the VCU Foundation Web site at. 28 I VCU Shafer Court Connections Class notes Send information about your professional and personal accomplishments to shafercourt[USER].edu.

Lower, M.D., who helped develop the tech- niques for transplanting a human heart and performed the ninth transplant in the U.S., died May 17, 2008, at his home in Twin Bridges, Mont. He was 78- Lower was a professor emeritus at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and for- mer chair of the Division of Cardlothoracic Surgery. He came to the VCU Medical Center, then the Medical College of Virginia, in 1965 from Stanford University Medical Center. In Richmond, Lower and his research team nearly performed the first heart transplant in the world, but a blood incompatibility issue kept them from operating. On May 25, 1968, Lower performed the first heart transplant in Virginia — just the l6th in the world — and while the patient's survival was short, it led to a landmark change in the legal definition of brain death, a decision that would forever benefit future transplant recipients. He retired from VCU in 1989.

Engineering faculty focuses on a diverse future for students Rosalyn Hobson originally wanted to go to medical school. She planned to earn an undergraduate degree in engineering - thinking that would give her an edge over students majoring in biology or chemistry - but by the second year, her mindset changed. \"I'm curious about how things work, and engineering gave me the opportunity to figure that out,\" she says. Hobson, the associate dean for graduate studies at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Engineering, has been involved with the engineering program since its inception in the mid-'90s. She recently sat down with Shafer Court Connections to discuss the importance of diversity and global opportunities in this eve'r- changing field. Most recently more women are pursuing careers in engineering. Why is that diversity important? Diversity provides a lot of different perspectives on how to solve problems. If you look at population demographics, about half the world is females. Imagine a profession that is so important to progress and so important to making life better, still has half the population not really engaged in it or even thinking of it as a possible career choice. By bringing together a diverse group of people, including women, you can get innovative solutions. Why are international experiences important for you to participate in? Just like engineering was always part of my family, international experiences were, too. I'm fascinated with other cultures. I believe that we are citizens of the world because of the connectedness, the global interactions and the linkages of individuals and multinational companies. The decisions people make in one country not only impact their bordering countries but now affect economies around the world. We can't just live in our own corner, and I don't want to. What have been some of your international experiences? In 2001, I received my first in- ternational grant to facilitate a partnership with a university in South Africa. We've taken stu- dents to work in South Africa on research projects that were relevant to their studies. I was i an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and studied the role of science and technology in international development. I'm now the direc- tor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal partnership, one of VCU's 16 strategic international partnerships. Weddings 2000S Kim Miller (M.S.

(Hereinafter referred to as`this work\")CDOT and the City of Boulder believe it will be beneficial to perform this work because it will improve visibility by removing sight distance obstructions, slow bicyclists speeds on their approach to these intersections and reduce the number of crashes involving bicyclists and through vehicles. This work will conform to the parameters articulated in the Colorado Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, AASHTO\"A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets\",AASHTO\"Roadside Design Guide\",and the CDOT Project Development Manual, CDOT M&amp;S Standards, CDOT Design Guide,CDOT Construction Manual, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices,Highway Capacity Manual,along with all applicable State and Federal guidelines. This work will consist of the straightening of 29°Street to intersect with Baseline Road at a right angle and detachment of the north multi-use path on the approach to the 291 Street intersection. Additional traffic signal infrastructure and the construction of a southbound right-tum lane to help reduce right-of-way conflicts between bicyclists and vehicles will be completed at the intersection of SH 93 and Rayleigh. There will also be new lane configurations for vehicle and bicyclist traffic at the intersection of Colorado Ave. and Regent Drive. The design phase of this work is scheduled to begin during federal fiscal year 2018.The design phase will identify more exact requirements, qualities, and attributes for this work. (Herein after referred to as `the exact work\"). The exact work shall be used to complete the construction phase of the project. The construction phase of the project is estimated to begin in federal fiscal year 2019 and shall finish as soon as reasonably possible. EXHIBIT B.

A Kalman Filter Based Technique for Stator Turn-Fault Detection of the Induction Motors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ghanbari, Teymoor; Samet, Haidar 2017-11-01 Monitoring of the Induction Motors (IMs) through stator current for different faults diagnosis has considerable economic and technical advantages in comparison with the other techniques in this content. Among different faults of an IM, stator and bearing faults are more probable types, which can be detected by analyzing signatures of the stator currents. One of the most reliable indicators for fault detection of IMs is lower sidebands of power frequency in the stator currents. This paper deals with a novel simple technique for detecting stator turn-fault of the IMs. Frequencies of the lower sidebands are determined using the motor specifications and their amplitudes are estimated by a Kalman Filter (KF). Instantaneous Total Harmonic Distortion (ITHD) of these harmonics is calculated. Since variation of the ITHD for the three-phase currents is considerable in case of stator turn-fault, the fault can be detected using this criterion, confidently. Different simulation results verify high performance of the proposed method. The performance of the method is also confirmed using some experiments. Detection of broken rotor bar faults in induction motor at low load using neural network. Bessam, B; Menacer, A; Boumehraz, M; Cherif, H 2016-09-01 The knowledge of the broken rotor bars characteristic frequencies and amplitudes has a great importance for all related diagnostic methods. The monitoring of motor faults requires a high resolution spectrum to separate different frequency components. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) has been widely used to achieve these requirements. However, at low slip this technique cannot give good results. As a solution for these problems, this paper proposes an efficient technique based on a neural network approach and Hilbert transform (HT) for broken rotor bar diagnosis in induction machines at low load. The Hilbert transform is used to extract the stator current envelope (SCE). Two features are selected from the (SCE) spectrum (the amplitude and frequency of the harmonic). These features will be used as input for neural network. The results obtained are astonishing and it is capable to detect the correct number of broken rotor bars under different load conditions.

Mechanical fault detection of electric motors by laser vibrometer and accelerometer measurements NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cristalli, C.; Paone, N.; Rodríguez, R. M. 2006-08-01 This paper presents a comparative study between accelerometer and laser vibrometer measurements aimed at on-line quality control carried out on the universal motors used in washing machines, which exhibit defects localised mainly in the bearings, including faults in the cage, in the rolling element and in the outer and inner ring. A set of no defective and defective motors were analysed by means of the acceleration signal provided by the accelerometer, and the displacement and velocity signals given by a single-point laser vibrometer. Advantages and disadvantages of both absolute and relative sensors and of contact and non-contact instrumentation are discussed taking into account the applicability to real on-line quality control measurements and bringing to light the related measurement problems due to the specific environmental conditions of assembly lines and sensor installation constraints. The performance of different signal-processing algorithms is discussed: RMS computation at steady-state proves effective for pass or fail diagnosis, while the amplitude of selected frequencies in the averaged spectra allows also for classification of a variety of special faults in bearings. Joint time-frequency analysis output data can be successfully used for pass or fail diagnosis during transients, thus achieving a remarkable reduction in testing time, which is important for on-line diagnostics. Induction motor broken rotor bar fault location detection through envelope analysis of start-up current using Hilbert transform NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Abd-el-Malek, Mina; Abdelsalam, Ahmed K.; Hassan, Ola E. 2017-09-01 Robustness, low running cost and reduced maintenance lead Induction Motors (IMs) to pioneerly penetrate the industrial drive system fields. Broken rotor bars (BRBs) can be considered as an important fault that needs to be early assessed to minimize the maintenance cost and labor time. The majority of recent BRBs' fault diagnostic techniques focus on differentiating between healthy and faulty rotor cage. In this paper, a new technique is proposed for detecting the location of the broken bar in the rotor. The proposed technique relies on monitoring certain statistical parameters estimated from the analysis of the start-up stator current envelope. The envelope of the signal is obtained using Hilbert Transformation (HT). The proposed technique offers non-invasive, fast computational and accurate location diagnostic process. Various simulation scenarios are presented that validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. A simple approach to detect and correct signal faults of Hall position sensors for brushless DC motors at steady speed NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Shi, Yongli; Wu, Zhong; Zhi, Kangyi; Xiong, Jun 2018-03-01 In order to realize reliable commutation of brushless DC motors (BLDCMs), a simple approach is proposed to detect and correct signal faults of Hall position sensors in this paper. First, the time instant of the next jumping edge for Hall signals is predicted by using prior information of pulse intervals in the last electrical period. Considering the possible errors between the predicted instant and the real one, a confidence interval is set by using the predicted value and a suitable tolerance for the next pulse edge. According to the relationship between the real pulse edge and the confidence interval, Hall signals can be judged and the signal faults can be corrected. Experimental results of a BLDCM at steady speed demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. A review and comparison of fault detection and diagnosis methods for squirrel-cage induction motors: State of the art. Liu, Yiqi; Bazzi, Ali M 2017-09-01 Preventing induction motors (IMs) from failure and shutdown is important to maintain functionality of many critical loads in industry and commerce. This paper provides a comprehensive review of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods targeting all the four major types of faults in IMs. Popular FDD methods published up to 2010 are briefly introduced, while the focus of the review is laid on the state-of-the-art FDD techniques after 2010, i.e. in 2011-2015 and some in 2016. Different FDD methods are introduced and classified into four categories depending on their application domains, instead of on fault types like in many other reviews, to better reveal hidden connections and similarities of different FDD methods. Detailed comparisons of the reviewed papers after 2010 are given in tables for fast referring. Finally, a dedicated discussion session is provided, which presents recent developments, trends and remaining difficulties regarding to FDD of IMs, to inspire novel research ideas and new research possibilities.

Online Detection of Broken Rotor Bar Fault in Induction Motors by Combining Estimation of Signal Parameters via Min-norm Algorithm and Least Square Method NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Pan-Pan; Yu, Qiang; Hu, Yong-Jun; Miao, Chang-Xin 2017-11-01 Current research in broken rotor bar (BRB) fault detection in induction motors is primarily focused on a high-frequency resolution analysis of the stator current. Compared with a discrete Fourier transformation, the parametric spectrum estimation technique has a higher frequency accuracy and resolution. However, the existing detection methods based on parametric spectrum estimation cannot realize online detection, owing to the large computational cost. To improve the efficiency of BRB fault detection, a new detection method based on the min-norm algorithm and least square estimation is proposed in this paper. First, the stator current is filtered using a band-pass filter and divided into short overlapped data windows. The min-norm algorithm is then applied to determine the frequencies of the fundamental and fault characteristic components with each overlapped data window. Next, based on the frequency values obtained, a model of the fault current signal is constructed. Subsequently, a linear least squares problem solved through singular value decomposition is designed to estimate the amplitudes and phases of the related components. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a simulated current and an actual motor, the results of which indicate that, not only parametric spectrum estimation technique.more ».« less Randomness fault detection system NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Russell, B. Don (Inventor); Aucoin, B. Michael (Inventor); Benner, Carl L. (Inventor) 1996-01-01 A method and apparatus are provided for detecting a fault on a power line carrying a line parameter such as a load current. The apparatus monitors and analyzes the load current to obtain an energy value. The energy value is compared to a threshold value stored in a buffer. If the energy value is greater than the threshold value a counter is incremented. If the energy value is greater than a high value threshold or less than a low value threshold then a second counter is incremented. If the difference between two subsequent energy values is greater than a constant then a third counter is incremented. A fault signal is issued if the counter is greater than a counter limit value and either the second counter is greater than a second limit value or the third counter is greater than a third limit value. Cage-rotor induction motor inter-turn short circuit fault detection with and without saturation effect by MEC model. Naderi, Peyman 2016-09-01 The inter-turn short fault for the Cage-Rotor-Induction-Machine (CRIM) is studied in this paper and its local saturation is taken into account. However, in order to observe the exact behavior of machine, the Magnetic-Equivalent-Circuit (MEC) and nonlinear B-H curve are proposed to provide an insight into the machine model and saturation effect respectively. The electrical machines are generally operated near to their saturation zone due to some design necessities. Hence, when the machine is exposed to a fault such as short circuit or eccentricities, it is operated within its saturation zone and thus, time and space harmonics are integrated and as a result, current and torque harmonics are generated which the phenomenon cannot be explored when saturation is dismissed. Nonetheless, inter-turn short circuit may lead to local saturation and this occurrence is studied in this paper using MEC model. In order to achieve the mentioned objectives, two and also four-pole machines are modeled as two samples and the machines performances are analyzed in healthy and faulty cases with and without saturation effect. A novel strategy is proposed to precisely detect inter-turn short circuit fault according to the stator׳s lines current signatures and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.

An Intelligent Harmonic Synthesis Technique for Air-Gap Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Li, De Z.; Wang, Wilson; Ismail, Fathy 2017-11-01 Induction motors (IMs) are commonly used in various industrial applications. To improve energy consumption efficiency, a reliable IM health condition monitoring system is very useful to detect IM fault at its earliest stage to prevent operation degradation, and malfunction of IMs. An intelligent harmonic synthesis technique is proposed in this work to conduct incipient air-gap eccentricity fault detection in IMs. The fault harmonic series are synthesized to enhance fault features. Fault related local spectra are processed to derive fault indicators for IM air-gap eccentricity diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed harmonic synthesis technique is examined experimentally by IMs with static air-gap eccentricity and dynamic air-gap eccentricity states under different load conditions. Test results show that the developed harmonic synthesis technique can extract fault features effectively for initial IM air-gap eccentricity fault detection. Discrete wavelet transform and energy eigen value for rotor bars fault detection in variable speed field-oriented control of induction motor drive. Ameid, Tarek; Menacer, Arezki; Talhaoui, Hicham; Azzoug, Youness 2018-05-03 This paper presents a methodology for the broken rotor bars fault detection is considered when the rotor speed varies continuously and the induction machine is controlled by Field-Oriented Control (FOC). The rotor fault detection is obtained by analyzing a several mechanical and electrical quantities (i.e., rotor speed, stator phase current and output signal of the speed regulator) by the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in variable speed drives. The severity of the fault is obtained by stored energy calculation for active power signal. Hence, it can be a useful solution as fault indicator. The FOC is implemented in order to preserve a good performance speed control; to compensate the broken rotor bars effect in the mechanical speed and to ensure the operation continuity and to investigate the fault effect in the variable speed. The effectiveness of the technique is evaluated in simulation and in a real-time implementation by using Matlab/Simulink with the real-time interface (RTI) based on dSpace 1104 board.

Fault detection and isolation for complex system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jing, Chan Shi; Bayuaji, Luhur; Samad, R.; Mustafa, M.; Abdullah, N. R. H.; Zain, Z. M.; Pebrianti, Dwi 2017-07-01 Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) is a method to monitor, identify, and pinpoint the type and location of system fault in a complex multiple input multiple output (MIMO) non-linear system. A two wheel robot is used as a complex system in this study. The aim of the research is to construct and design a Fault Detection and Isolation algorithm. The proposed method for the fault identification is using hybrid technique that combines Kalman filter and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The Kalman filter is able to recognize the data from the sensors of the system and indicate the fault of the system in the sensor reading. Error prediction is based on the fault magnitude and the time occurrence of fault. Additionally, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is another algorithm used to determine the type of fault and isolate the fault in the system. Various Indices for Diagnosis of Air-gap Eccentricity Fault in Induction Motor-A Review NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Nikhil; Mathew, Lini, Dr.; Sharma, Amandeep 2018-03-01 From the past few years, research has gained an ardent pace in the field of fault detection and diagnosis in induction motors. In the current scenario, software is being introduced with diagnostic features to improve stability and reliability in fault diagnostic techniques. Human involvement in decision making for fault detection is slowly being replaced by Artificial Intelligence techniques. In this paper, a brief introduction of eccentricity fault is presented along with their causes and effects on the health of induction motors. Various indices used to detect eccentricity are being introduced along with their boundary conditions and their future scope of research. At last, merits and demerits of all indices are discussed and a comparison is made between them.. Integral Sensor Fault Detection and Isolation for Railway Traction Drive.

Infrared thermography based diagnosis of inter-turn fault and cooling system failure in three phase induction motor NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Singh, Gurmeet; Naikan, V. N. A. 2017-12-01 Thermography has been widely used as a technique for anomaly detection in induction motors. International Electrical Testing Association (NETA) proposed guidelines for thermographic inspection of electrical systems and rotating equipment. These guidelines help in anomaly detection and estimating its severity. However, it focus only on location of hotspot rather than diagnosing the fault. This paper addresses two such faults i.e. inter-turn fault and failure of cooling system, where both results in increase of stator temperature. Present paper proposes two thermal profile indicators using thermal analysis of IRT images. These indicators are in compliance with NETA standard. These indicators help in correctly diagnosing inter-turn fault and failure of cooling system. The work has been experimentally validated for healthy and with seeded faults scenarios of induction motors.

However, it remains poorly understood whether RSCM are useful for detecting past frictional heating on faults. To detect increased heating during seismic slip, we examine the thrust fault in the Jurassic accretionary complex, central Japan. The thrust fault zone includes 10 cm-thick cataclasite and a few mm-thick dark layer. The cataclasite is characterized by fragments of black and gray chert in the black carbonaceous mudstone matrix. The dark layer is marked by intensely cracked gray chert fragments in the dark matrix of carbonaceous mudstone composition, which bounds the fractured gray chert above from the cataclasite below. The RSCM are analyzed for carbonaceous material in the cataclasite, dark layer, and host rock <10 mm from cataclasite and dark layer boundaries. The result indicates that there is no increased carbonization in the cataclasite. In contrast, the dark layer and part of host rocks <2 mm from the dark layer boundaries show prominent increase in carbonization. The absent of increased carbonization in the cataclasite could be attributed to insufficient frictional heating associated with distributed shear and/or faulting at low slip rates. The dark layer exhibits the appearance of fault and injection veins, and the dark layer boundaries are irregularly embayed or intensely cracked; these features have been characteristically observed in pseudotachylytes. Therefore, the increased carbonization in the dark layer is likely resulted from increased heating during earthquake faulting. The intensely cracked fragments in the dark layer and cracked wall rocks may reflect thermal fracturing in chert, which is caused by heat conduction from the molten zone. We suggest that RSCM are useful for the detection of increased heating on faults, particularly when the temperature is high enough for frictional melting and thermal fracturing.. PMID:22163789. Latent component-based gear tooth fault detection filter using advanced parametric modeling NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ettefagh, M. M.; Sadeghi, M. H.; Rezaee, M.; Chitsaz, S. 2009-10-01 In this paper, a new parametric model-based filter is proposed for gear tooth fault detection. The designing of the filter consists of identifying the most proper latent component (LC) of the undamaged gearbox signal by analyzing the instant modules (IMs) and instant frequencies (IFs) and then using the component with lowest IM as the proposed filter output for detecting fault of the gearbox. The filter parameters are estimated by using the LC theory in which an advanced parametric modeling method has been implemented. The proposed method is applied on the signals, extracted from simulated gearbox for detection of the simulated gear faults. In addition, the method is used for quality inspection of the produced Nissan-Junior vehicle gearbox by gear profile error detection in an industrial test bed. For evaluation purpose, the proposed method is compared with the previous parametric TAR/AR-based filters in which the parametric model residual is considered as the filter output and also Yule-Walker and Kalman filter are implemented for estimating the parameters. The results confirm the high performance of the new proposed fault detection method.. Wind turbine fault detection and classification by means of image texture analysis NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ruiz, Magda; Mujica, Luis E.; Alférez, Santiago; Acho, Leonardo; Tutivén, Christian; Vidal, Yolanda; Rodellar, José; Pozo, Francesc 2018-07-01 The future of the wind energy industry passes through the use of larger and more flexible wind turbines in remote locations, which are increasingly offshore to benefit stronger and more uniform wind conditions. The cost of operation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines is approximately 15-35% of the total cost. Of this, 80% goes towards unplanned maintenance issues due to different faults in the wind turbine components. Thus, an auspicious way to contribute to the increasing demands and challenges is by applying low-cost advanced fault detection schemes. This work proposes a new method for detection and classification of wind turbine actuators and sensors faults in variable-speed wind turbines. For this purpose, time domain signals acquired from the operating wind turbine are represented as two-dimensional matrices to obtain grayscale digital images. Then, the image pattern recognition is processed getting texture features under a multichannel representation. In this work, four types of texture characteristics are used: statistical, wavelet, granulometric and Gabor features. Next, the most significant ones are selected using the conditional mutual criterion. Finally, the faults are detected and distinguished between them (classified) using an automatic classification tool. In particular, a 10-fold cross-validation is used to obtain a more generalized model and evaluates the classification performance. Coupled non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulations of a 5 MW offshore type wind turbine are carried out in several fault scenarios. The results show a promising methodology able to detect and classify the most common wind turbine faults.. Rule-based fault diagnosis of hall sensors and fault-tolerant control of PMSM NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Song, Ziyou; Li, Jianqiu; Ouyang, Minggao; Gu, Jing; Feng, Xuning; Lu, Dongbin 2013-07-01 Hall sensor is widely used for estimating rotor phase of permanent magnet synchronous motor(PMSM). And rotor position is an essential parameter of PMSM control algorithm, hence it is very dangerous if Hall senor faults occur. But there is scarcely any research focusing on fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of Hall sensor used in PMSM. From this standpoint, the Hall sensor faults which may occur during the PMSM operating are theoretically analyzed. According to the analysis results, the fault diagnosis algorithm of Hall sensor, which is based on three rules, is proposed to classify the fault phenomena accurately. The rotor phase estimation algorithms, based on one or two Hall sensor(s), are initialized to engender the fault-tolerant control algorithm. The fault diagnosis algorithm can detect 60 Hall fault phenomena in total as well as all detections can be fulfilled in 1/138 rotor rotation period. The fault-tolerant control algorithm can achieve a smooth torque production which means the same control effect as normal control mode (with three Hall sensors). Finally, the PMSM bench test verifies the accuracy and rapidity of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control strategies. The fault diagnosis algorithm can detect all Hall sensor faults promptly and fault-tolerant control algorithm allows the PMSM to face failure conditions of one or two Hall sensor(s). In addition, the transitions between health-control and fault-tolerant control conditions are smooth without any additional noise and harshness. Proposed algorithms can deal with the Hall sensor faults of PMSM in real applications, and can be provided to realize the fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control of PMSM.

The CPRBF network consists of a number of radial basis function (RBF) subnets connected in parallel. The number of input nodes for each RBF subnet is determined by different embedding dimension based on chaotic phase-space reconstruction. The output of CPRBF is a weighted sum of all RBF subnets. It was first trained using the dataset from normal state without fault, and then a residual error generator was designed to detect failures based on the trained CPRBF network. Then, failure detection can be achieved by the analysis of the residual error. Finally, two case studies are introduced to compare the proposed CPRBF network with traditional RBF networks, in terms of prediction and detection accuracy.. An adaptive confidence limit for periodic non-steady conditions fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Tianzhen; Wu, Hao; Ni, Mengqi; Zhang, Milu; Dong, Jingjing; Benbouzid, Mohamed El Hachemi; Hu, Xiong 2016-05-01 System monitoring has become a major concern in batch process due to the fact that failure rate in non-steady conditions is much higher than in steady ones. A series of approaches based on PCA have already solved problems such as data dimensionality reduction, multivariable decorrelation, and processing non-changing signal. However, if the data follows non-Gaussian distribution or the variables contain some signal changes, the above approaches are not applicable. To deal with these concerns and to enhance performance in multiperiod data processing, this paper proposes a fault detection method using adaptive confidence limit (ACL) in periodic non-steady conditions. The proposed ACL method achieves four main enhancements: Longitudinal-Standardization could convert non-Gaussian sampling data to Gaussian ones; the multiperiod PCA algorithm could reduce dimensionality, remove correlation, and improve the monitoring accuracy; the adaptive confidence limit could detect faults under non-steady conditions; the fault sections determination procedure could select the appropriate parameter of the adaptive confidence limit. The achieved result analysis clearly shows that the proposed ACL method is superior to other fault detection approaches under periodic non-steady conditions..

Failure detection and fault management techniques for flush airdata sensing systems NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Whitmore, Stephen A.; Moes, Timothy R.; Leondes, Cornelius T. 1992-01-01 Methods based on chi-squared analysis are presented for detecting system and individual-port failures in the high-angle-of-attack flush airdata sensing system on the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle. The HI-FADS hardware is introduced, and the aerodynamic model describes measured pressure in terms of dynamic pressure, angle of attack, angle of sideslip, and static pressure. Chi-squared analysis is described in the presentation of the concept for failure detection and fault management which includes nominal, iteration, and fault-management modes. A matrix of pressure orifices arranged in concentric circles on the nose of the aircraft indicate the parameters which are applied to the regression algorithms. The sensing techniques are applied to the F-18 flight data, and two examples are given of the computed angle-of-attack time histories. The failure-detection and fault-management techniques permit the matrix to be multiply redundant, and the chi-squared analysis is shown to be useful in the detection of failures.

Set-membership fault detection under noisy environment with application to the detection of abnormal aircraft control surface positions NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) El Houda Thabet, Rihab; Combastel, Christophe; Raïssi, Tarek; Zolghadri, Ali 2015-09-01 The paper develops a set membership detection methodology which is applied to the detection of abnormal positions of aircraft control surfaces. Robust and early detection of such abnormal positions is an important issue for early system reconfiguration and overall optimisation of aircraft design. In order to improve fault sensitivity while ensuring a high level of robustness, the method combines a data-driven characterisation of noise and a model-driven approach based on interval prediction. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is illustrated through simulation results obtained based on data recorded in several flight scenarios of a highly representative aircraft benchmark..

An imbalance fault detection method based on data normalization and EMD for marine current turbines. Zhang, Milu; Wang, Tianzhen; Tang, Tianhao; Benbouzid, Mohamed; Diallo, Demba 2017-05-01 This paper proposes an imbalance fault detection method based on data normalization and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for variable speed direct-drive Marine Current Turbine (MCT) system. The method is based on the MCT stator current under the condition of wave and turbulence. The goal of this method is to extract blade imbalance fault feature, which is concealed by the supply frequency and the environment noise. First, a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) detector is developed and the monitoring variable is selected by analyzing the relationship between the variables. Then, the selected monitoring variable is converted into a time series through data normalization, which makes the imbalance fault characteristic frequency into a constant. At the end, the monitoring variable is filtered out by EMD method to eliminate the effect of turbulence. The experiments show that the proposed method is robust against turbulence through comparing the different fault severities and the different turbulence intensities. Comparison with other methods, the experimental results indicate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method. Copyright © 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Detection, isolation and diagnosability analysis of intermittent faults in stochastic systems NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yan, Rongyi; He, Xiao; Wang, Zidong; Zhou, D. H. 2018-02-01 Intermittent faults (IFs) have the properties of unpredictability, non-determinacy, inconsistency and repeatability, switching systems between faulty and healthy status. In this paper, the fault detection and isolation (FDI) problem of IFs in a class of linear stochastic systems is investigated. For the detection and isolation of IFs, it includes: (1) to detect all the appearing time and the disappearing time of an IF; (2) to detect each appearing (disappearing) time of the IF before the subsequent disappearing (appearing) time; (3) to determine where the IFs happen. Based on the outputs of the observers we designed, a novel set of residuals is constructed by using the sliding-time window technique, and two hypothesis tests are proposed to detect all the appearing time and disappearing time of IFs. The isolation problem of IFs is also considered. Furthermore, within a statistical framework, the definition of the diagnosability of IFs is proposed, and a sufficient condition is brought forward for the diagnosability of IFs. Quantitative performance analysis results for the false alarm rate and missing detection rate are discussed, and the influences of some key parameters of the proposed scheme on performance indices such as the false alarm rate and missing detection rate are analysed rigorously. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated via a simulation example of an unmanned helicopter longitudinal control system.

Data-driven fault detection, isolation and estimation of aircraft gas turbine engine actuator and sensors NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). Integrated ensemble noise-reconstructed empirical mode decomposition for mechanical fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yuan, Jing; Ji, Feng; Gao, Yuan; Zhu, Jun; Wei, Chenjun; Zhou, Yu 2018-05-01 A new branch of fault detection is utilizing the noise such as enhancing, adding or estimating the noise so as to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and extract the fault signatures. Hereinto, ensemble noise-reconstructed empirical mode decomposition (ENEMD) is a novel noise utilization method to ameliorate the mode mixing and denoised the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Despite the possibility of superior performance in detecting weak and multiple faults, the method still suffers from the major problems of the user-defined parameter and the powerless capability for a high SNR case. Hence, integrated ensemble noise-reconstructed empirical mode decomposition is proposed to overcome the drawbacks, improved by two noise estimation techniques for different SNRs as well as the noise estimation strategy. Independent from the artificial setup, the noise estimation by the minimax thresholding is improved for a low SNR case, which especially shows an outstanding interpretation for signature enhancement. For approximating the weak noise precisely, the noise estimation by the local reconfiguration using singular value decomposition (SVD) is proposed for a high SNR case, which is particularly powerful for reducing the mode mixing. Thereinto, the sliding window for projecting the phase space is optimally designed by the correlation minimization. Meanwhile, the reasonable singular order for the local reconfiguration to estimate the noise is determined by the inflection point of the increment trend of normalized singular entropy. Furthermore, the noise estimation strategy, i.e. the selection approaches of the two estimation techniques along with the critical case, is developed and discussed for different SNRs by means of the possible noise-only IMF family. The method is validated by the repeatable simulations to demonstrate the synthetical performance and especially confirm the capability of noise estimation. Finally, the method is applied to detect the local wear fault 49 CFR 392.66 - Carbon monoxide; use of commercial motor vehicle when detected.

Fault detection for discrete-time LPV systems using interval observers NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zhang, Zhi-Hui; Yang, Guang-Hong 2017-10-01 This paper is concerned with the fault detection (FD) problem for discrete-time linear parameter-varying systems subject to bounded disturbances. A parameter-dependent FD interval observer is designed based on parameter-dependent Lyapunov and slack matrices. The design method is presented by translating the parameter-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) into finite ones. In contrast to the existing results based on parameter-independent and diagonal Lyapunov matrices, the derived disturbance attenuation, fault sensitivity and nonnegative conditions lead to less conservative LMI characterisations. Furthermore, without the need to design the residual evaluation functions and thresholds, the residual intervals generated by the interval observers are used directly for FD decision. Finally, simulation results are presented for showing the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Spontaneous non-volcanic tremor detected in the Anza Seismic Gap of San Jacinto Fault NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Hutchison, A. A.; Ghosh, A. 2017-12-01 Non-volcanic tremor (NVT), a type of slow earthquake, is becoming more frequently detected along plate boundaries, particularly in subduction zones, and is also observed along the San Andreas Fault [e.g. Nadeau & Dolenc, 2005]. NVT is typically associated with transient deformation (i.e. slow slip) in the transition zone [e.g. Ide et al., 2007], and at times it is observed with deep creep along faults [e.g. Beroza & Ide, 2011]. Using several independent location and detection methods including multi-beam backprojection [Ghosh et al., 2009a; 2012], envelope cross correlation [Wech & Creager, 2008], spectral analyses and visual inspection of existing network stations and high-density mini seismic array data, we detect multiple discrete spontaneous tremor events in the Anza Gap of the San Jacinto Fault (SJF) in June, 2011. The events occur on the SJF where the Hot Springs Fault terminates, on the northwestern boundary of the Anza Gap, below the inferred seismogenic zone characterized by velocity weakening frictional behavior [e.g. Lindsay et al., 2014]. The location methods provide consistent locations for each event in our catalog. Low slowness values help rule-out surface noise that may result in false detections. Analyses of frequency spectra show these time windows are depleted in high frequency energy in the displacement amplitude spectrum compared to small local regular (fast) earthquakes. This spectral pattern is characteristic of tremor [Shelly et al., 2007]. We interpret this tremor to be a seismic manifestation of slow-slip events below the seismogenic zone. Recently, an independent geodetic study suggests that the 2010 El Mayor-Cucupah earthquake triggered a slow-slip event in the Anza Gap [Inbal et al., 2017]. In addition, multiple studies infer deep creep in the SJF [e.g. Meng & Peng et al., 2016; Jiang & Fialko, 2016] indicating that this fault is capable of producing slow slip events. Transient tectonic behavior like tremor and slow slip may be playing Real World Experience With Ion Implant Fault Detection at Freescale Semiconductor NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Sing, David C.; Breeden, Terry; Fakhreddine, Hassan; Gladwin, Steven; Locke, Jason; McHugh, Jim; Rendon, Michael 2006-11-01 The Freescale automatic fault detection and classification (FDC) system has logged data from over 3.5 million implants in the past two years. The Freescale FDC system is a low cost system which collects summary implant statistics at the conclusion of each implant run. The data is collected by either downloading implant data log files from the implant tool workstation, or by exporting summary implant statistics through the tool's automation interface. Compared to the traditional FDC systems which gather trace data from sensors on the tool as the implant proceeds, the Freescale FDC system cannot prevent scrap when a fault initially occurs, since the data is collected after the implant concludes. However, the system can prevent catastrophic scrap events due to faults which are not detected for days or weeks, leading to the loss of hundreds or thousands of wafers. At the Freescale ATMC facility, the practical applications of the FD system fall into two categories: PM trigger rules which monitor tool signals such as ion gauges and charge control signals, and scrap prevention rules which are designed to detect specific failure modes that have been correlated to yield loss and scrap. PM trigger rules are designed to detect shifts in tool signals which indicate normal aging of tool systems. For example, charging parameters gradually shift as flood gun assemblies age, and when charge control rules start to fail a flood gun PM is performed. Scrap prevention rules are deployed to detect events such as particle bursts and excessive beam noise, events which have been correlated to yield loss. The FDC system does have tool log-down capability, and scrap prevention rules often use this capability to automatically log the tool into a maintenance state while simultaneously paging the sustaining technician for data review and disposition of the affected product.. Invariant protection of high-voltage electric motors of technological complexes at industrial enterprises at partial single-phase ground faults NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Abramovich, B. N.; Sychev, Yu A.; Pelenev, D. N. 2018-03-01 Development results of invariant protection of high-voltage motors at incomplete single-phase ground faults are observed in the article. It is established that current protections have low action selectivity because of an inadmissible decrease in entrance signals during the shirt circuit occurrence in the place of transient resistance. The structural functional scheme and an algorithm of protective actions where correction of automatic zero sequence currents signals of the protected accessions implemented according to the level of incompleteness of ground faults are developed. It is revealed that automatic correction of zero sequence currents allows one to provide the invariance of sensitivity factor for protection under the variation conditions of a transient resistance in the place of damage. Application of invariant protection allows one to minimize damages in 6-10 kV electrical installations of industrial enterprises for a cause of infringement of consumers’ power supply and their system breakdown due to timely localization of emergency of ground faults modes. Weighted low-rank sparse model via nuclear norm minimization for bearing fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Du, Zhaohui; Chen, Xuefeng; Zhang, Han; Yang, Boyuan; Zhai, Zhi; Yan, Ruqiang 2017-07-01 It is a fundamental task in the machine fault diagnosis community to detect impulsive signatures generated by the localized faults of bearings. The main goal of this paper is to exploit the low-rank physical structure of periodic impulsive features and further establish a weighted low-rank sparse model for bearing fault detection. The proposed model mainly consists of three basic components: an adaptive partition window, a nuclear norm regularization and a weighted sequence. Firstly, due to the periodic repetition mechanism of impulsive feature, an adaptive partition window could be designed to transform the impulsive feature into a data matrix. The highlight of partition window is to accumulate all local feature information and align them. Then, all columns of the data matrix share similar waveforms and a core physical phenomenon arises, i.e., these singular values of the data matrix demonstrates a sparse distribution pattern. Therefore, a nuclear norm regularization is enforced to capture that sparse prior. However, the nuclear norm regularization treats all singular values equally and thus ignores one basic fact that larger singular values have more information volume of impulsive features and should be preserved as much as possible. Therefore, a weighted sequence with adaptively tuning weights inversely proportional to singular amplitude is adopted to guarantee the distribution consistence of large singular values. On the other hand, the proposed model is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and thus a new algorithm is developed to search one satisfying stationary solution through alternatively implementing one proximal operator operation and least-square fitting. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis and selection principles of algorithmic parameters are comprehensively investigated through a set of numerical experiments, which shows that the proposed method is robust and only has a few adjustable parameters. Lastly, the proposed model is applied to the An autonomous fault detection, isolation, and recovery system for a 20-kHz electric power distribution test bed NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Quinn, Todd M.; Walters, Jerry L. 1991-01-01 Future space explorations will require long term human presence in space. Space environments that provide working and living quarters for manned missions are becoming increasingly larger and more sophisticated. Monitor and control of the space environment subsystems by expert system software, which emulate human reasoning processes, could maintain the health of the subsystems and help reduce the human workload. The autonomous power expert (APEX) system was developed to emulate a human expert's reasoning processes used to diagnose fault conditions in the domain of space power distribution. APEX is a fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) system, capable of autonomous monitoring and control of the power distribution system. APEX consists of a knowledge base, a data base, an inference engine, and various support and interface software. APEX provides the user with an easy-to-use interactive interface. When a fault is detected, APEX will inform the user of the detection. The user can direct APEX to isolate the probable cause of the fault. Once a fault has been isolated, the user can ask APEX to justify its fault isolation and to recommend actions to correct the fault. APEX implementation and capabilities are discussed. About the Power Generation Confirmation of the Induction Motor and the Influence on the Islanding Detection Device NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Igarashi, Hironobu; Sato, Takashi; Miyamoto, Kazunori; Kurokawa, Kousuke The photovoltaic generation system must have protection device and islanding detection devices to connect with utility line of the electric power company. It is regulated in the technological requirement guideline and the electric equipment technology standard that the country provides. The islanding detection device detected purpose install for blackout due to the accident occurrence of the earth fault and the short-circuit in the utility line. When the islanding detection device detects the power blackout, it is necessary to stop the photovoltaic generation system immediately. If the photovoltaic generation system is not stopped immediately, electricity comes to charge the utility power line very at risk. We had already known that the islanding detection device can't detect the islanding phenomenon, if is there the induction motor in the loads. Authors decided to investigate the influence that the induction motors gave to the islanding detection device. The result was the load condition that the induction motors changed generator the voltage is restraining. Moreover, it was clarified that the time of the islanding was long compared with the load condition of not changing into the state of the generator. The value changes into the reactance of the induction motors according to the frequency change after the supply of electric power line stops. The frequency after the supply of electric power line stops changes for the unbalance the reactive power by the effect of the power rate constancy control with PLL of the power conditioner. However, the induction motors is also to the changing frequency, makes amends for the amount of reactive power, and the change in the frequency after the supply of electric power line stops as a result is controlled. When the frequency changed after the supply of electric power line stopped, it was clarified of the action on the direction where it made amends from the change of the constant for the amount of an invalid electric power, and Tacholess order-tracking approach for wind turbine gearbox fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Yi; Xie, Yong; Xu, Guanghua; Zhang, Sicong; Hou, Chenggang 2017-09-01. Orbital maneuvering subsystem functional path analysis for performance monitoring fault detection and annunciation NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Keesler, E. L. 1974-01-01 The functional paths of the Orbital Maneuver Subsystem (OMS) is defined. The operational flight instrumentation required for performance monitoring, fault detection, and annunciation is described. The OMS is a pressure fed rocket engine propulsion subsystem. One complete OMS shares each of the two auxiliary propulsion subsystem pods with a reaction control subsystem. Each OMS is composed of a pressurization system, a propellant tanking system, and a gimbaled rocket engine. The design, development, and operation of the system are explained. Diagrams of the system are provided. Using recurrence plot analysis for software execution interpretation and fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mosdorf, M. 2015-09-01 This paper shows a method targeted at software execution interpretation and fault detection using recurrence plot analysis. In in the proposed approach recurrence plot analysis is applied to software execution trace that contains executed assembly instructions. Results of this analysis are subject to further processing with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method that simplifies number coefficients used for software execution classification. This method was used for the analysis of five algorithms: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Median Filter, FIR, SHA-1. Results show that some of the collected traces could be easily assigned to particular algorithms (logs from Bubble Sort and FIR algorithms) while others are more difficult to distinguish. Towards Certification of a Space System Application of Fault Detection and Isolation NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Feather, Martin S.; Markosian, Lawrence Z. 2008-01-01 Advanced fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) software is being investigated at NASA as a means to the improve reliability and availability of its space systems. Certification is a critical step in the acceptance of such software. Its attainment hinges on performing the necessary verification and validation to show that the software will fulfill its requirements in the intended setting. Presented herein is our ongoing work to plan for the certification of a pilot application of advanced FDIR software in a NASA setting. We describe the application, and the key challenges and opportunities it offers for certification. Hidden Markov models and neural networks for fault detection in dynamic systems NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Smyth, Padhraic 1994-01-01 Neural networks plus hidden Markov models (HMM) can provide excellent detection and false alarm rate performance in fault detection applications, as shown in this viewgraph presentation. Modified models allow for novelty detection. Key contributions of neural network models are: (1) excellent nonparametric discrimination capability; (2) a good estimator of posterior state probabilities, even in high dimensions, and thus can be embedded within overall probabilistic model (HMM); and (3) simple to implement compared to other nonparametric models. Neural network/HMM monitoring model is currently being integrated with the new Deep Space Network (DSN) antenna controller software and will be on-line monitoring a new DSN 34-m antenna (DSS-24) by July, 1994. Fast computation of the kurtogram for the detection of transient faults NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Antoni, Jérôme 2007-01-01 The kurtogram is a fourth-order spectral analysis tool recently introduced for detecting and characterising non-stationarities in a signal. The paradigm relies on the assertion that each type of transient is associated with an optimal (frequency/frequency resolution) dyad { f,Δf} which maximises its kurtosis, and hence its detection. However, the complete exploration of the whole plane ( f,Δf) is a formidable task hardly amenable to on-line industrial applications. In this communication we describe a fast algorithm for computing the kurtogram over a grid that finely samples the ( f,Δf) plane. Its complexity is on the order of N log N, similarly to the FFT. The efficiency of the algorithm is then illustrated on several industrial cases concerned with the detection of incipient transient faults. Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution and Convolution Fix: Application to vibration fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) McDonald, Geoff L.; Zhao, Qing 2017-01-01 Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been applied successfully to rotating machine fault detection from vibration data, however this method has limitations. A convolution adjustment to the MED definition and solution is proposed in this paper to address the discontinuity at the start of the signal - in some cases causing spurious impulses to be erroneously deconvolved. A problem with the MED solution is that it is an iterative selection process, and will not necessarily design an optimal filter for the posed problem. Additionally, the problem goal in MED prefers to deconvolve a single-impulse, while in rotating machine faults we expect one impulse-like vibration source per rotational period of the faulty element. Maximum Correlated Kurtosis Deconvolution was proposed to address some of these problems, and although it solves the target goal of multiple periodic impulses, it is still an iterative non-optimal solution to the posed problem and only solves for a limited set of impulses in a row. Ideally, the problem goal should target an impulse train as the output goal, and should directly solve for the optimal filter in a non-iterative manner. To meet these goals, we propose a non-iterative deconvolution approach called Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution Adjusted (MOMEDA). MOMEDA proposes a deconvolution problem with an infinite impulse train as the goal and the optimal filter solution can be solved for directly. From experimental data on a gearbox with and without a gear tooth chip, we show that MOMEDA and its deconvolution spectrums according to the period between the impulses can be used to detect faults and study the health of rotating machine elements effectively. Thermal Fault Tolerance Analysis of Carbon Fiber Rope Barrier Systems for Use in the Reusable Solid Rocket Motor ( RSRM) Nozzle Joints NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Clayton, J. Louie; Phelps, Lisa (Technical Monitor) 2001-01-01 Carbon Fiber Rope (CFR) thermal barrier systems are being considered for use in several RSRM (Reusable Solid Rocket Motor) nozzle joints as a replacement for the current assembly gap close-out process/design. This study provides for development and test verification of analysis methods used for flow-thermal modeling of a CFR thermal barrier subject to fault conditions such as rope combustion gas blow-by and CFR splice failure. Global model development is based on a 1-D (one dimensional) transient volume filling approach where the flow conditions are calculated as a function of internal 'pipe' and porous media 'Darcy' flow correlations. Combustion gas flow rates are calculated for the CFR on a per-linear inch basis and solved simultaneously with a detailed thermal-gas dynamic model of a local region of gas blow by (or splice fault). Effects of gas compressibility, friction and heat transfer are accounted for the model. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) solutions of the fault regions are used to characterize the local flow field, quantify the amount of free jet spreading and assist in the determination of impingement film coefficients on the nozzle housings. Gas to wall heat transfer is simulated by a large thermal finite element grid of the local structure. The employed numerical technique loosely couples the FE (Finite Element) solution with the gas dynamics solution of the faulted region. All free constants that appear in the governing equations are calibrated by hot fire sub-scale test. The calibrated model is used to make flight predictions using motor aft end environments and timelines. Model results indicate that CFR barrier systems provide a near 'vented joint' style of pressurization. Hypothetical fault conditions considered in this study (blow by, splice defect) are relatively benign in terms of overall heating to nozzle metal housing structures. A KPI-based process monitoring and fault detection framework for large-scale processes. Zhang, Kai; Shardt, Yuri A W; Chen, Zhiwen; Yang, Xu; Ding, Steven X; Peng, Kaixiang 2017-05-01.

Detection of faults in rotating machinery using periodic time-frequency sparsity NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Ding, Yin; He, Wangpeng; Chen, Binqiang; Zi, Yanyang; Selesnick, Ivan W. 2016-11-01 This paper addresses the problem of extracting periodic oscillatory features in vibration signals for detecting faults in rotating machinery. To extract the feature, we propose an approach in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain where the periodic oscillatory feature manifests itself as a relatively sparse grid. To estimate the sparse grid, we formulate an optimization problem using customized binary weights in the regularizer, where the weights are formulated to promote periodicity. In order to solve the proposed optimization problem, we develop an algorithm called augmented Lagrangian majorization-minimization algorithm, which combines the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm (SALSA) with majorization-minimization (MM), and is guaranteed to converge for both convex and non-convex formulation. As examples, the proposed approach is applied to simulated data, and used as a tool for diagnosing faults in bearings and gearboxes for real data, and compared to some state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed approach can effectively detect and extract the periodical oscillatory features. Fault detection in rotating machines with beamforming: Spatial visualization of diagnosis features NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cardenas Cabada, E.; Leclere, Q.; Antoni, J.; Hamzaoui, N. 2017-12-01 Rotating machines diagnosis is conventionally related to vibration analysis. Sensors are usually placed on the machine to gather information about its components. The recorded signals are then processed through a fault detection algorithm allowing the identification of the failing part. This paper proposes an acoustic-based diagnosis method. A microphone array is used to record the acoustic field radiated by the machine. The main advantage over vibration-based diagnosis is that the contact between the sensors and the machine is no longer required. Moreover, the application of acoustic imaging makes possible the identification of the sources of acoustic radiation on the machine surface. The display of information is then spatially continuous while the accelerometers only give it discrete. Beamforming provides the time-varying signals radiated by the machine as a function of space. Any fault detection tool can be applied to the beamforming output. Spectral kurtosis, which highlights the impulsiveness of a signal as function of frequency, is used in this study. The combination of spectral kurtosis with acoustic imaging makes possible the mapping of the impulsiveness as a function of space and frequency. The efficiency of this approach lays on the source separation in the spatial and frequency domains. These mappings make possible the localization of such impulsive sources. The faulty components of the machine have an impulsive behavior and thus will be highlighted on the mappings. The study presents experimental validations of the method on rotating machines.. PMID:22163766 Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) Portable Liquid Oxygen Hardware Demonstrator NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Oostdyk, Rebecca L.; Perotti, Jose M. 2011-01-01 The Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) hardware demonstration will highlight the effort being conducted by Constellation's Ground Operations (GO) to provide the Launch Control System (LCS) with system-level health management during vehicle processing and countdown activities. A proof-of-concept demonstration of the FDIR prototype established the capability of the software to provide real-time fault detection and isolation using generated Liquid Hydrogen data. The FDIR portable testbed unit (presented here) aims to enhance FDIR by providing a dynamic simulation of Constellation subsystems that feed the FDIR software live data based on Liquid Oxygen system properties. The LO2 cryogenic ground system has key properties that are analogous to the properties of an electronic circuit. The LO2 system is modeled using electrical components and an equivalent circuit is designed on a printed circuit board to simulate the live data. The portable testbed is also be equipped with data acquisition and communication hardware to relay the measurements to the FDIR application running on a PC. This portable testbed is an ideal capability to perform FDIR software testing, troubleshooting, training among others. Early Oscillation Detection for Hybrid DC/DC Converter Fault Diagnosis NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Wang, Bright L. 2011-01-01 This paper describes a novel fault detection technique for hybrid DC/DC converter oscillation diagnosis. The technique is based on principles of feedback control loop oscillation and RF signal modulations, and Is realized by using signal spectral analysis. Real-circuit simulation and analytical study reveal critical factors of the oscillation and indicate significant correlations between the spectral analysis method and the gain/phase margin method. A stability diagnosis index (SDI) is developed as a quantitative measure to accurately assign a degree of stability to the DC/DC converter. This technique Is capable of detecting oscillation at an early stage without interfering with DC/DC converter's normal operation and without limitations of probing to the converter. Lessons Learned on Implementing Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) in a Ground Launch Environment NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Ferrell, Bob A.; Lewis, Mark E.; Perotti, Jose M.; Brown, Barbara L.; Oostdyk, Rebecca L.; Goetz, Jesse W. 2010-01-01 This paper's main purpose is to detail issues and lessons learned regarding designing, integrating, and implementing Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) for Constellation Exploration Program (CxP) Ground Operations at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Part of the0 overall implementation of National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) CxP, FDIR is being implemented in three main components of the program (Ares, Orion, and Ground Operations/Processing). While not initially part of the design baseline for the CxP Ground Operations, NASA felt that FDIR is important enough to develop, that NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate's (ESMD's) Exploration Technology Development Program (ETDP) initiated a task for it under their Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) research area. This task, referred to as the FDIIR project, is a multi-year multi-center effort. The primary purpose of the FDIR project is to develop a prototype and pathway upon which Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) may be transitioned into the Ground Operations baseline. Currently, Qualtech Systems Inc (QSI) Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software products Testability Engineering and Maintenance System (TEAMS) Designer and TEAMS RDS/RT are being utilized in the implementation of FDI within the FDIR project. The TEAMS Designer COTS software product is being utilized to model the system with Functional Fault Models (FFMs). A limited set of systems in Ground Operations are being modeled by the FDIR project, and the entire Ares Launch Vehicle is being modeled under the Functional Fault Analysis (FFA) project at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Integration of the Ares FFMs and the Ground Processing FFMs is being done under the FDIR project also utilizing the TEAMS Designer COTS software product. One of the most significant challenges related to integration is to ensure that FFMs developed by different organizations can be integrated easily and without errors. Software Interface Performance analysis of a fault inferring nonlinear detection system algorithm with integrated avionics flight data NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Caglayan, A. K.; Godiwala, P. M.; Morrell, F. R. 1985-01-01 This paper presents the performance analysis results of a fault inferring nonlinear detection system (FINDS) using integrated avionics sensor flight data for the NASA ATOPS B-737 aircraft in a Microwave Landing System (MLS) environment. First, an overview of the FINDS algorithm structure is given. Then, aircraft state estimate time histories and statistics for the flight data sensors are discussed. This is followed by an explanation of modifications made to the detection and decision functions in FINDS to improve false alarm and failure detection performance. Next, the failure detection and false alarm performance of the FINDS algorithm are analyzed by injecting bias failures into fourteen sensor outputs over six repetitive runs of the five minutes of flight data. Results indicate that the detection speed, failure level estimation, and false alarm performance show a marked improvement over the previously reported simulation runs. In agreement with earlier results, detection speed is faster for filter measurement sensors such as MLS than for filter input sensors such as flight control accelerometers. Finally, the progress in modifications of the FINDS algorithm design to accommodate flight computer constraints is discussed.

A single dynamic observer-based module for design of simultaneous fault detection, isolation and tracking control scheme NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Davoodi, M.; Meskin, N.; Khorasani, K. 2018-03-01 The problem of simultaneous fault detection, isolation and tracking (SFDIT) control design for linear systems subject to both bounded energy and bounded peak disturbances is considered in this work. A dynamic observer is proposed and implemented by using the H∞/H-/L1 formulation of the SFDIT problem. A single dynamic observer module is designed that generates the residuals as well as the control signals. The objective of the SFDIT module is to ensure that simultaneously the effects of disturbances and control signals on the residual signals are minimised (in order to accomplish the fault detection goal) subject to the constraint that the transfer matrix from the faults to the residuals is equal to a pre-assigned diagonal transfer matrix (in order to accomplish the fault isolation goal), while the effects of disturbances, reference inputs and faults on the specified control outputs are minimised (in order to accomplish the fault-tolerant and tracking control goals). A set of linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility conditions are derived to ensure solvability of the problem. In order to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design methodology, the developed and proposed schemes are applied to an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle (AUV). Fault detection for singular switched linear systems with multiple time-varying delay in finite frequency domain NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zhai, Ding; Lu, Anyang; Li, Jinghao; Zhang, Qingling 2016-10-01 This paper deals with the problem of the fault detection (FD) for continuous-time singular switched linear systems with multiple time-varying delay. In this paper, the actuator fault is considered. Besides, the systems faults and unknown disturbances are assumed in known frequency domains. Some finite frequency performance indices are initially introduced to design the switched FD filters which ensure that the filtering augmented systems under switching signal with average dwell time are exponentially admissible and guarantee the fault input sensitivity and disturbance robustness. By developing generalised Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov lemma and using Parseval's theorem and Fourier transform, finite frequency delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter which can guarantee the finite-frequency H- and H∞ performance are derived and formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Four examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed finite frequency method.. Motion-Based System Identification and Fault Detection and Isolation Technologies for Thruster Controlled Spacecraft NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Wilson, Edward; Sutter, David W.; Berkovitz, Dustin; Betts, Bradley J.; Kong, Edmund; delMundo, Rommel; Lages, Christopher R.; Mah, Robert W.; Papasin, Richard 2003-01-01 By analyzing the motions of a thruster-controlled spacecraft, it is possible to provide on-line (1) thruster fault detection and isolation (FDI), and (2) vehicle mass- and thruster-property identification (ID). Technologies developed recently at NASA Ames have significantly improved the speed and accuracy of these ID and FDI capabilities, making them feasible for application to a broad class of spacecraft. Since these technologies use existing sensors, the improved system robustness and performance that comes with the thruster fault tolerance and system ID can be achieved through a software-only implementation. This contrasts with the added cost, mass, and hardware complexity commonly required by FDI. Originally developed in partnership with NASA - Johnson Space Center to provide thruster FDI capability for the X-38 during re-entry, these technologies are most recently being applied to the MIT SPHERES experimental spacecraft to fly on the International Space Station in 2004. The model-based FDI uses a maximum-likelihood calculation at its core, while the ID is based upon recursive least squares estimation. Flight test results from the SPHERES implementation, as flown aboard the NASA KC-1 35A 0-g simulator aircraft in November 2003 are presented.

PMID:25196008 Detection and localization of building insulation faults using optical-fiber DTS system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Papes, Martin; Liner, Andrej; Koudelka, Petr; Siska, Petr; Cubik, Jakub; Kepak, Stanislav; Jaros, Jakub; Vasinek, Vladimir 2013-05-01 Nowadays the trends in the construction industry are changing at an incredible speed. The new technologies are still emerging on the market. Sphere of building insulation is not an exception as well. One of the major problems in building insulation is usually its failure, whether caused by unwanted mechanical intervention or improper installation. The localization of these faults is quite difficult, often impossible without large intervention into the construction. As a proper solution for this problem might be utilization of Optical-Fiber DTS system based on stimulated Raman scattering. Used DTS system is primary designed for continuous measurement of the temperature along the optical fiber. This system is using standard optical fiber as a sensor, which brings several advantages in its application. First, the optical fiber is relatively inexpensive, which allows to cover a quite large area for a small cost. The other main advantages of the optical fiber are electromagnetic resistance, small size, safety operation in inflammable or explosive area, easy installation, etc. This article is dealing with the detection and localization of building insulation faults using mentioned system. Minimum entropy deconvolution optimized sinusoidal synthesis and its application to vibration based fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Li, Gang; Zhao, Qing 2017-03-01 In this paper, a minimum entropy deconvolution based sinusoidal synthesis (MEDSS) filter is proposed to improve the fault detection performance of the regular sinusoidal synthesis (SS) method. The SS filter is an efficient linear predictor that exploits the frequency properties during model construction. The phase information of the harmonic components is not used in the regular SS filter. However, the phase relationships are important in differentiating noise from characteristic impulsive fault signatures. Therefore, in this work, the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) technique is used to optimize the SS filter during the model construction process. A time-weighted-error Kalman filter is used to estimate the MEDSS model parameters adaptively. Three simulation examples and a practical application case study are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The regular SS method and the autoregressive MED (ARMED) method are also implemented for comparison. The MEDSS model has demonstrated superior performance compared to the regular SS method and it also shows comparable or better performance with much less computational intensity than the ARMED method. Fault detection and isolation of high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack under the influence of degradation NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Jeppesen, Christian; Araya, Samuel Simon; Sahlin, Simon Lennart; Thomas, Sobi; Andreasen, Søren Juhl; Kær, Søren Knudsen 2017-08-01 This study proposes a data-drive impedance-based methodology for fault detection and isolation of low and high cathode stoichiometry, high CO concentration in the anode gas, high methanol vapour concentrations in the anode gas and low anode stoichiometry, for high temperature PEM fuel cells. The fault detection and isolation algorithm is based on an artificial neural network classifier, which uses three extracted features as input. Two of the proposed features are based on angles in the impedance spectrum, and are therefore relative to specific points, and shown to be independent of degradation, contrary to other available feature extraction methods in the literature. The experimental data is based on a 35 day experiment, where 2010 unique electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded. The test of the algorithm resulted in a good detectability of the faults, except for high methanol vapour concentration in the anode gas fault, which was found to be difficult to distinguish from a normal operational data. The achieved accuracy for faults related to CO pollution, anode- and cathode stoichiometry is 100% success rate. Overall global accuracy on the test data is 94.6%.

Phase editing as a signal pre-processing step for automated bearing fault detection NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Barbini, L.; Ompusunggu, A. P.; Hillis, A. J.; du Bois, J. L.; Bartic, A. 2017-07-01 Scheduled maintenance and inspection of bearing elements in industrial machinery contributes significantly to the operating costs. Savings can be made through automatic vibration-based damage detection and prognostics, to permit condition-based maintenance. However automation of the detection process is difficult due to the complexity of vibration signals in realistic operating environments. The sensitivity of existing methods to the choice of parameters imposes a requirement for oversight from a skilled operator. This paper presents a novel approach to the removal of unwanted vibrational components from the signal: phase editing. The approach uses a computationally-efficient full-band demodulation and requires very little oversight. Its effectiveness is tested on experimental data sets from three different test-rigs, and comparisons are made with two state-of-the-art processing techniques: spectral kurtosis and cepstral pre- whitening. The results from the phase editing technique show a 10% improvement in damage detection rates compared to the state-of-the-art while simultaneously improving on the degree of automation. This outcome represents a significant contribution in the pursuit of fully automatic fault detection. Preliminary Study on Acoustic Detection of Faults Experienced by a High-Bypass Turbofan Engine NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Boyle, Devin K. 2014-01-01 The vehicle integrated propulsion research (VIPR) effort conducted by NASA and several partners provided an unparalleled opportunity to test a relatively low TRL concept regarding the use of far field acoustics to identify faults occurring in a high bypass turbofan engine. Though VIPR Phase II ground based aircraft installed engine testing wherein a multitude of research sensors and methods were evaluated, an array of acoustic microphones was used to determine the viability of such an array to detect failures occurring in a commercially representative high bypass turbofan engine. The failures introduced during VIPR testing included commanding the engine's low pressure compressor (LPC) exit and high pressure compressor (HPC) 14th stage bleed values abruptly to their failsafe positions during steady state. Evaluation of an expert system for fault detection, isolation, and recovery in the manned maneuvering unit NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Rushby, John; Crow, Judith 1990-01-01 The authors explore issues in the specification, verification, and validation of artificial intelligence (AI) based software, using a prototype fault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) system for the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU). They use this system as a vehicle for exploring issues in the semantics of C-Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS)-style rule-based languages, the verification of properties relating to safety and reliability, and the static and dynamic analysis of knowledge based systems. This analysis reveals errors and shortcomings in the MMU FDIR system and raises a number of issues concerning software engineering in CLIPs. The authors came to realize that the MMU FDIR system does not conform to conventional definitions of AI software, despite the fact that it was intended and indeed presented as an AI system. The authors discuss this apparent disparity and related questions such as the role of AI techniques in space and aircraft operations and the suitability of CLIPS for critical applications. A Fuzzy Reasoning Design for Fault Detection and Diagnosis of a Computer-Controlled System Ting, Y.; Lu, W.B.; Chen, C.H.; Wang, G.K. 2008-01-01 A Fuzzy Reasoning and Verification Petri Nets (FRVPNs) model is established for an error detection and diagnosis mechanism (EDDM) applied to a complex fault-tolerant PC-controlled system. The inference accuracy can be improved through the hierarchical design of a two-level fuzzy rule decision tree (FRDT) and a Petri nets (PNs) technique to transform the fuzzy rule into the FRVPNs model. Several simulation examples of the assumed failure events were carried out by using the FRVPNs and the Mamdani fuzzy method with MATLAB tools. The reasoning performance of the developed FRVPNs was verified by comparing the inference outcome to that of the Mamdani method. Both methods result in the same conclusions. Thus, the present study demonstratrates that the proposed FRVPNs model is able to achieve the purpose of reasoning, and furthermore, determining of the failure event of the monitored application program. PMID:19255619 Test Generation Algorithm for Fault Detection of Analog Circuits Based on Extreme Learning Machine Zhou, Jingyu; Tian, Shulin; Yang, Chenglin; Ren, Xuelong 2014-01-01 This paper proposes a novel test generation algorithm based on extreme learning machine (ELM), and such algorithm is cost-effective and low-risk for analog device under test (DUT). This method uses test patterns derived from the test generation algorithm to stimulate DUT, and then samples output responses of the DUT for fault classification and detection. The novel ELM-based test generation algorithm proposed in this paper contains mainly three aspects of innovation. Firstly, this algorithm saves time efficiently by classifying response space with ELM. Secondly, this algorithm can avoid reduced test precision efficiently in case of reduction of the number of impulse-response samples. Thirdly, a new process of test signal generator and a test structure in test generation algorithm are presented, and both of them are very simple. Finally, the abovementioned improvement and functioning are confirmed in experiments. PMID:25610458 Fault detection in heavy duty wheels by advanced vibration processing techniques and lumped parameter modeling NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Malago`, M.; Mucchi, E.; Dalpiaz, G. 2016-03-01 Heavy duty wheels are used in applications such as automatic vehicles and are mainly composed of a polyurethane tread glued to a cast iron hub. In the manufacturing process, the adhesive application between tread and hub is a critical assembly phase, since it is completely made by an operator and a contamination of the bond area may happen. Furthermore, the presence of rust on the hub surface can contribute to worsen the adherence interface, reducing the operating life. In this scenario, a quality control procedure for fault detection to be used at the end of the manufacturing process has been developed. This procedure is based on vibration processing techniques and takes advantages of the results of a lumped parameter model. Indicators based on cyclostationarity can be considered as key parameters to be adopted in a monitoring test station at the end of the production line due to their not deterministic characteristics.

Amozegar, M; Khorasani, K 2016-04-01 In this paper, a new approach for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) of gas turbine engines is proposed by developing an ensemble of dynamic neural network identifiers. For health monitoring of the gas turbine engine, its dynamics is first identified by constructing three separate or individual dynamic neural network architectures. Specifically, a dynamic multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a dynamic radial-basis function (RBF) neural network, and a dynamic support vector machine (SVM) are trained to individually identify and represent the gas turbine engine dynamics. Next, three ensemble-based techniques are developed to represent the gas turbine engine dynamics, namely, two heterogeneous ensemble models and one homogeneous ensemble model. It is first shown that all ensemble approaches do significantly improve the overall performance and accuracy of the developed system identification scheme when compared to each of the stand-alone solutions. The best selected stand-alone model (i.e., the dynamic RBF network) and the best selected ensemble architecture (i.e., the heterogeneous ensemble) in terms of their performances in achieving an accurate system identification are then selected for solving the FDI task. The required residual signals are generated by using both a single model-based solution and an ensemble-based solution under various gas turbine engine health conditions. Our extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the fault detection and isolation task achieved by using the residuals that are obtained from the dynamic ensemble scheme results in a significantly more accurate and reliable performance as illustrated through detailed quantitative confusion matrix analysis and comparative studies.

Estimation of fault geometry of a slow slip event off the Kii Peninsula, southwest of Japan, detected by DONET NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Suzuki, K.; Nakano, M.; Hori, T.; Takahashi, N. 2015-12-01 The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology installed permanent ocean bottom observation network called Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) off the Kii Peninsula, southwest of Japan, to monitor earthquakes and tsunamis. We detected the long-term vertical displacements of sea floor from the ocean-bottom pressure records, starting from March 2013, at several DONET stations (Suzuki et al., 2014). We consider that these displacements were caused by the crustal deformation due to a slow slip event (SSE). We estimated the fault geometry of the SSE by using the observed ocean-bottom displacements. The ocean-bottom displacements were obtained by removing the tidal components from the pressure records. We also subtracted the average of pressure changes taken over the records at stations connected to each science node from each record in order to remove the contributions due to atmospheric pressure changes and non-tidal ocean dynamic mass variations. Therefore we compared observed displacements with the theoretical ones that was subtracted the average displacement in the fault geometry estimation. We also compared observed and theoretical average displacements for the model evaluation. In this study, the observed average displacements were assumed to be zero. Although there are nine parameters in the fault model, we observed vertical displacements at only four stations. Therefore we assumed three fault geometries; (1) a reverse fault slip along the plate boundary, (2) a strike slip along a splay fault, and (3) a reverse fault slip along the splay fault. We obtained that the model (3) gives the smallest residual between observed and calculated displacements. We also observed that this SSE was synchronized with a decrease in the background seismicity within the area of a nearby earthquake cluster. In the future, we will investigate the relationship between the SSE and the seismicity change.. Final Technical Report Recovery Act: Online Nonintrusive Condition Monitoring and Fault Detection for Wind Turbines Wei Qiao 2012-05-29 The penetration of wind power has increased greatly over the last decade in the United States and across the world. The U.S. wind power industry installed 1,118 MW of new capacity in the first quarter of 2011 alone and entered the second quarter with another 5,600 MW under construction. By 2030, wind energy is expected to provide 20% of the U.S. electricity needs. As the number of wind turbines continues to grow, the need for effective condition monitoring and fault detection (CMFD) systems becomes increasingly important [3]. Online CMFD is an effective means of not only improving the reliability, capacitymore » factor, and lifetime, but it also reduces the downtime, energy loss, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines. The goal of this project is to develop novel online nonintrusive CMFD technologies for wind turbines. The proposed technologies use only the current measurements that have been used by the control and protection system of a wind turbine generator (WTG); no additional sensors or data acquisition devices are needed. Current signals are reliable and easily accessible from the ground without intruding on the wind turbine generators (WTGs) that are situated on high towers and installed in remote areas. Therefore, current-based CMFD techniques have great economic benefits and the potential to be adopted by the wind energy industry. Specifically, the following objectives and results have been achieved in this project: (1) Analyzed the effects of faults in a WTG on the generator currents of the WTG operating at variable rotating speed conditions from the perspective of amplitude and frequency modulations of the current measurements; (2) Developed effective amplitude and frequency demodulation methods for appropriate signal conditioning of the current measurements to improve the accuracy and reliability of wind turbine CMFD; (3) Developed a 1P-invariant power spectrum density (PSD) method for effective signature extraction of wind turbine Fault detection and accommodation testing on an F100 engine in an F-15 airplane. [digital engine control system NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Myers, L. P.; Baer-Riedhart, J. L.; Maxwell, M. D. 1985-01-01 The fault detection and accommodation (FDA) methods that can be used for digital engine control systems are presently subjected to a flight test program in the case of the F-15 fighter's F100 engine electronic controls, inducing selected faults and then evaluating the resulting digital engine control responses. In general, flight test results were found to compare well with both ground tests and predictions. It is noted that the inducement of dual-pressure failures was not feasible, since FDA logic was not designed to accommodate them. Selective detection and characterization of nanoparticles from motor vehicles. Johnston, Murray V; Klems, Joseph P; Zordan, Christopher A; Pennington, M Ross; Smith, James N 2013-02-01 Numerous studies have shown that exposure to motor vehicle emissions increases the probability of heart attacks, asthma attacks, and hospital visits among at-risk individuals. However, while many studies have focused on measurements of ambient nanoparticles near highways, they have not focused on specific road-level domains, such as intersections near population centers. At these locations, very intense spikes in particle number concentration have been observed. These spikes have been linked to motor vehicle activity and have the potential to increase exposure dramatically. Characterizing both the contribution and composition of these spikes is critical in developing exposure models and abatement strategies. To determine the contribution of the particle spikes to the ambient number concentration, we implemented wavelet-based algorithms to isolate the particle spikes from measurements taken during the summer and winter of 2009 in Wilmington, Delaware, adjacent to a roadway intersection that approximately 28,000 vehicles pass through daily. These measurements included both number concentration and size distributions recorded once every second by a condensation particle counter (CPC*; TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN) and a fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS). The high-frequency portion of the signal, consisting of a series of abrupt spikes in number concentration that varied in length from a few seconds to tens of seconds, accounted for 3% to 35% of the daily ambient number concentration, with spike contributions sometimes greater than 50% of hourly number concentrations. When the data were weighted by particle volume, this portion of the signal contributed an average of 10% to 20% to the daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) < or = 0.1 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM0.1). The preferred locations for observing particle concentration spikes were those surrounding the measurement site at which motor vehicles accelerated after a red traffic light turned green.

The association between attributions of responsibility for motor vehicle accidents and patient satisfaction: a study within a no-fault injury compensation system. Thompson, Jason; Berk, Michael; O'Donnell, Meaghan; Stafford, Lesley; Nordfjaern, Trond 2015-05-01 This study set out to test the relationship between attributions of responsibility for motor vehicle accidents and satisfaction with personal injury compensation systems. The study analysed survey data from 1394 people injured in a motor vehicle accident who were compensated under a no-fault personal injury compensation system. Patients' ratings of satisfaction with the compensation system across five domains (resolves your issues, keeps you up-to-date, treats you as an individual, cares about you, and overall satisfaction) were analysed alongside patient attributions of responsibility for their accident (not responsible, partly responsible, totally responsible). Postaccident physical and mental health status, age, gender, and duration of compensation claim were controlled for in the analysis. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated attributions of responsibility for accidents were significantly associated with levels of patient satisfaction across all five domains under study (F (10, 2084) = 3.7, p<0.001, η(2) =0.02). Despite access to virtually indistinguishable services, patients who attributed responsibility for their accidents to others were significantly less satisfied with the injury compensation system than those who attributed responsibility to themselves. Satisfaction with no-fault motor vehicle injury compensation services are associated with patients' attributions of responsibility for their accident. Compensation systems and other rehabilitation services monitoring patient satisfaction should adjust for attributions of responsibility when assessing levels of patient satisfaction between time periods, services, or injured populations. Differences in levels of patient satisfaction observed between compensation or rehabilitation populations may reflect differences in attributions of responsibility for accidents rather than objective service quality. © The Author(s) 2014.-01-01 Purpose To examine whether an objective segmenation of corticospinal tract (CST) associated with hand and leg movements can be used to detect central motor weakness in the corresponding extremities in a pediatric population.

An optimized ensemble local mean decomposition method for fault detection of mechanical components NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Zhang, Chao; Li, Zhixiong; Hu, Chao; Chen, Shuai; Wang, Jianguo; Zhang, Xiaogang 2017-03-01 Mechanical transmission systems have been widely adopted in most of industrial applications, and issues related to the maintenance of these systems have attracted considerable attention in the past few decades. The recently developed ensemble local mean decomposition (ELMD) method shows satisfactory performance in fault detection of mechanical components for preventing catastrophic failures and reducing maintenance costs. However, the performance of ELMD often heavily depends on proper selection of its model parameters. To this end, this paper proposes an optimized ensemble local mean decomposition (OELMD) method to determinate an optimum set of ELMD parameters for vibration signal analysis. In OELMD, an error index termed the relative root-mean-square error (Relative RMSE) is used to evaluate the decomposition performance of ELMD with a certain amplitude of the added white noise. Once a maximum Relative RMSE, corresponding to an optimal noise amplitude, is determined, OELMD then identifies optimal noise bandwidth and ensemble number based on the Relative RMSE and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), respectively. Thus, all three critical parameters of ELMD (i.e. noise amplitude and bandwidth, and ensemble number) are optimized by OELMD. The effectiveness of OELMD was evaluated using experimental vibration signals measured from three different mechanical components (i.e. the rolling bearing, gear and diesel engine) under faulty operation conditions.

L.; Shuchman, R. A.; Wagner, H.; Ruskey, F. 1977-01-01 Remote sensing was included in a comprehensive investigation of the use of geophysical techniques to aid in underground mine placement. The primary objective was to detect faults and slumping, features which, due to structural weakness and excess water, cause construction difficulties and safety hazards in mine construction. Preliminary geologic reconnaissance was performed on a potential site for an underground oil shale mine in the Piceance Creek Basin of Colorado. LANDSAT data, black and white aerial photography and 3 cm radar imagery were obtained. LANDSAT data were primarily used in optical imagery and digital tape forms, both of which were analyzed and enhanced by computer techniques. The aerial photography and radar data offered supplemental information. Surface linears in the test area were located and mapped principally from LANDSAT data. A specific, relatively wide, linear pointed directly toward the test site, but did not extend into it. Density slicing, ratioing, and edge enhancement of the LANDSAT data all indicated the existence of this linear. Radar imagery marginally confirmed the linear, while aerial photography did not confirm it.. User's guide to the Fault Inferring Nonlinear Detection System (FINDS) computer program NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Caglayan, A. K.; Godiwala, P. M.; Satz, H. S. 1988-01-01 Described are the operation and internal structure of the computer program FINDS (Fault Inferring Nonlinear Detection System). The FINDS algorithm is designed to provide reliable estimates for aircraft position, velocity, attitude, and horizontal winds to be used for guidance and control laws in the presence of possible failures in the avionics sensors. The FINDS algorithm was developed with the use of a digital simulation of a commercial transport aircraft and tested with flight recorded data. The algorithm was then modified to meet the size constraints and real-time execution requirements on a flight computer. For the real-time operation, a multi-rate implementation of the FINDS algorithm has been partitioned to execute on a dual parallel processor configuration: one based on the translational dynamics and the other on the rotational kinematics. The report presents an overview of the FINDS algorithm, the implemented equations, the flow charts for the key subprograms, the input and output files, program variable indexing convention, subprogram descriptions, and the common block descriptions used in the program. Detection of air-gap eccentricity and broken-rotor bar conditions in a squirrel-cage induction motor using the radial flux sensor Hwang, Don-Ha; Woo, Byung-Chul; Sun, Jong-Ho 2008-04-01 A new method for detecting eccentricity and broken rotor bar conditions in a squirrel-cage induction motor is proposed. Air-gap flux variation analysis is done using search coils, which are inserted at stator slots. Using this method, the leakage flux in radial direction can be directly detected. Using finite element method, the air-gap flux variation is accurately modeled and analyzed. From the results of the simulation, a motor under normal condition shows maximum magnetic flux density of 1.3 T. On the other hand, the eccentric air-gap condition displays about 1.1 T at 60 deg. and 1.6 T at 240 deg.

J.; Smith, M. 2016-12-01 (µ Fault detection on a sewer network by a combination of a Kalman filter and a binary sequential probability ratio test NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Piatyszek, E.; Voignier, P.; Graillot, D. 2000-05-01 One of the aims of sewer networks is the protection of population against floods and the reduction of pollution rejected to the receiving water during rainy events. To meet these goals, managers have to equip the sewer networks with and to set up real-time control systems. Unfortunately, a component fault (leading to intolerable behaviour of the system) or sensor fault (deteriorating the process view and disturbing the local automatism) makes the sewer network supervision delicate. In order to ensure an adequate flow management during rainy events it is essential to set up procedures capable of detecting and diagnosing these anomalies. This article introduces a real-time fault detection method, applicable to sewer networks, for the follow-up of rainy events. This method consists in comparing the sensor response with a forecast of this response. This forecast is provided by a model and more precisely by a state estimator: a Kalman filter. This Kalman filter provides not only a flow estimate but also an entity called 'innovation'. In order to detect abnormal operations within the network, this innovation is analysed with the binary sequential probability ratio test of Wald. Moreover, by crossing available information on several nodes of the network, a diagnosis of the detected anomalies is carried out. This method provided encouraging results during the analysis of several rains, on the sewer network of Seine-Saint-Denis County, France. Development of a variable structure-based fault detection and diagnosis strategy applied to an electromechanical system NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Gadsden, S. Andrew; Kirubarajan, T. 2017-05-01 Signal processing techniques are prevalent in a wide range of fields: control, target tracking, telecommunications, robotics, fault detection and diagnosis, and even stock market analysis, to name a few. Although first introduced in the 1950s, the most popular method used for signal processing and state estimation remains the Kalman filter (KF). The KF offers an optimal solution to the estimation problem under strict assumptions. Since this time, a number of other estimation strategies and filters were introduced to overcome robustness issues, such as the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF). In this paper, properties of the SVSF are explored in an effort to detect and diagnosis faults in an electromechanical system. The results are compared with the KF method, and future work is discussed.

Multi-Fault Detection of Rolling Element Bearings under Harsh Working Condition Using IMF-Based Adaptive Envelope Order Analysis Zhao, Ming; Lin, Jing; Xu, Xiaoqiang; Li, Xuejun 2014-01-01 When operating under harsh condition (e.g., time-varying speed and load, large shocks), the vibration signals of rolling element bearings are always manifested as low signal noise ratio, non-stationary statistical parameters, which cause difficulties for current diagnostic methods. As such, an IMF-based adaptive envelope order analysis (IMF-AEOA) is proposed for bearing fault detection under such conditions. This approach is established through combining the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), envelope order tracking and fault sensitive analysis. In this scheme, EEMD provides an effective way to adaptively decompose the raw vibration signal into IMFs with different frequency bands. The envelope order tracking is further employed to transform the envelope of each IMF to angular domain to eliminate the spectral smearing induced by speed variation, which makes the bearing characteristic frequencies more clear and discernible in the envelope order spectrum. Finally, a fault sensitive matrix is established to select the optimal IMF containing the richest diagnostic information for final decision making. The effectiveness of IMF-AEOA is validated by simulated signal and experimental data from locomotive bearings. The result shows that IMF-AEOA could accurately identify both single and multiple faults of bearing even under time-varying rotating speed and large extraneous shocks. PMID:25353982 Syntectonic Mississippi River Channel Response: Integrating River Morphology and Seismic Imaging to Detect Active Faults NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Magnani, M. B. 2017-12-01 Alluvial rivers, even great rivers such as the Mississippi, respond to hydrologic and geologic controls. Temporal variations of valley gradient can significantly alter channel morphology, as the river responds syntectonically to attain equilibrium. The river will alter its sinuosity, in an attempt to maintain a constant gradient on a surface that changes slope through time. Therefore, changes of river pattern can be the first clue that active tectonics is affecting an area of pattern change. Here I present geomorphological and seismic imaging evidence of a previously unknown fault crossing the Mississippi river south of the New Madrid seismic zone, between Caruthersville, Missouri and Osceola, Arkansas, and show that both datasets support Holocene fault movement, with the latest slip occurring in the last 200 years. High resolution marine seismic reflection data acquired along the Mississippi river imaged a NW-SE striking north-dipping fault displacing the base of the Quaternary alluvium by 15 m with reverse sense of movement. The fault consistently deforms the Tertiary, Cretaceous and Paleozoic formations. Historical river channel planforms dating back to 1765 reveal that the section of the river channel across the fault has been characterized by high sinuosity and steep projected-channel slope compared to adjacent river reaches. In particular, the reach across the fault experienced a cutoff in 1821, resulting in a temporary lowering of sinuosity followed by an increase between the survey of 1880 and 1915. Under the assumption that the change in sinuosity reflects river response to a valley slope change to maintain constant gradient, I use sinuosity through time to calculate the change in valley slope since 1880 and therefore to estimate the vertical displacement of the imaged fault in the past 200 years. Based on calculations so performed, the vertical offset of the fault is estimated to be 0.4 m, accrued since at least 1880. If the base of the river alluvium New procedure for gear fault detection and diagnosis using instantaneous angular speed NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Li, Bing; Zhang, Xining; Wu, Jili 2017-02-01 Besides the extreme complexity of gear dynamics, the fault diagnosis results in terms of vibration signal are sometimes easily misled and even distorted by the interference of transmission channel or other components like bearings, bars. Recently, the research field of Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) has attracted significant attentions due to its own advantages over conventional vibration analysis. On the basis of IAS signal's advantages, this paper presents a new feature extraction method by combining the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Autocorrelation Local Cepstrum (ALC) for fault diagnosis of sophisticated multistage gearbox. Firstly, as a pre-processing step, signal reconstruction is employed to address the oversampled issue caused by the high resolution of the angular sensor and the test speed. Then the adaptive EMD is used to acquire a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Nevertheless, not all the IMFs are needed for the further analysis since different IMFs have different sensitivities to fault. Hence, the cosine similarity metric is introduced to select the most sensitive IMF. Even though, the sensitive IMF is still insufficient for the gear fault diagnosis due to the weakness of the fault component related to the gear fault. Therefore, as the final step, ALC is used for the purpose of signal de-noising and feature extraction. The effectiveness and robustness of the new approach has been validated experimentally on the basis of two gear test rigs with gears under different working conditions. Diagnosis results show that the new approach is capable of effectively handling the gear fault diagnosis i.e., the highlighted quefrency and its rahmonics corresponding to the rotary period and its multiple are displayed clearly in the cepstrum record of the proposed method.

Detection of postseismic fault-zone collapse following the Landers earthquake NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Massonnet, Didier; Thatcher, Wayne; Vadon, Hélèna 1996-08-01 STRESS changes caused by fault movement in an earthquake induce transient aseismic crustal movements in the earthquake source region that continue for months to decades following large events1-4. These motions reflect aseismic adjustments of the fault zone and/or bulk deformation of the surroundings in response to applied stresses2,5-7, and supply information regarding the inelastic behaviour of the Earth's crust. These processes are imperfectly understood because it is difficult to infer what occurs at depth using only surface measurements2,6-8. Using Near Surface P and S Wave Velocities and Seismic Reflection Images to Detect the Westerly Extension of the Active Meishan Fault in Southwestern Taiwan NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Putriani, E.; Huang, W. H.; Shih, R. C. 2017-12-01 The Southwestern Taiwan has higher potential seismic risks among the island. In 1906 the Meishan earthquake of magnitude 7.1 caused very severe damages. The associated Meishan fault was believed extended from Meishan westerly to Hsingang area for 23 km long; however, only the eastern part of the fault could be traces on the surface. The western part of the Meishan fault was simply proposed from the observed lineation of sand blow from the middle of the fault, the Minhsiung area westerly to the Hsingang area. The purpose of this paper is hope to prove the extension of this fault by using near surface P wave and S wave velocities and the seismic reflection images acquired across the suspicious fault location. Totally, we have conducted 20 seismic velocity survey lines, which were deployed in six areas with and without liquefaction observed, and 2 seismic reflection lines. The P and S wave velocities variations were used to analyze depth of the water table, the elastic modulus, soil porosity and the safety factor for soil liquefaction assessment. Preliminary result of the seismic velocity distribution was effective within 17 m deep from surface and showed no particular difference at the sites of liquefaction observed or no liquefaction. The results could indicate that the sand blow observed in 1906 were not site dependent, but more likely related to activity of the Meishan fault. In order to detect the detailed fault trace, the seismic reflection images will be combined for interpreting the buried Meishan fault in the final result..

Methods Abnormal spontaneous high frequency motor fibre activity is a sensitive and specific endpoint of acute oxaliplatin-induced motor nerve hyperexcitability, detectable A new iterative approach for multi-objective fault detection observer design and its application to a hypersonic vehicle NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Huang, Di; Duan, Zhisheng 2018-03-01 This paper addresses the multi-objective fault detection observer design problems for a hypersonic vehicle. Owing to the fact that parameters' variations, modelling errors and disturbances are inevitable in practical situations, system uncertainty is considered in this study. By fully utilising the orthogonal space information of output matrix, some new understandings are proposed for the construction of Lyapunov matrix. Sufficient conditions for the existence of observers to guarantee the fault sensitivity and disturbance robustness in infinite frequency domain are presented. In order to further relax the conservativeness, slack matrices are introduced to fully decouple the observer gain with the Lyapunov matrices in finite frequency range. Iterative linear matrix inequality algorithms are proposed to obtain the solutions. The simulation examples which contain a Monte Carlo campaign illustrate that the new methods can effectively reduce the design conservativeness compared with the existing methods.

M. 1997-09-01 The purpose of condition monitoring and fault diagnostics are to detect and distinguish faults occurring in machinery, in order to provide a significant improvement in plant economy, reduce operational and maintenance costs and improve the level of safety. The condition of a model drive-line, consisting of various interconnected rotating parts, including an actual vehicle gearbox, two bearing housings, and an electric motor, all connected via flexible couplings and loaded by a disc brake, was investigated. This model drive-line was run in its normal condition, and then single and multiple faults were introduced intentionally to the gearbox, and to the one of the bearing housings. These single and multiple faults studied on the drive-line were typical bearing and gear faults which may develop during normal and continuous operation of this kind of rotating machinery. This paper presents the investigation carried out in order to study both bearing and gear faults introduced first separately as a single fault and then together as multiple faults to the drive-line. The real time domain vibration signals obtained for the drive-line were preprocessed by wavelet transforms for the neural network to perform fault detection and identify the exact kinds of fault occurring in the model drive-line. It is shown that by using multilayer artificial neural networks on the sets of preprocessed data by wavelet transforms, single and multiple faults were successfully detected and classified into distinct groups.

PMID:25760051 Acoustic Detection of Faults and Degradation in a High-Bypass Turbofan Engine during VIPR Phase III Testing NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Boyle, Devin K. 2017-01-01 The Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) Phase III project was executed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and several industry, academic, and government partners in the summer of 2015. One of the research objectives was to use external radial acoustic microphone arrays to detect changes in the noise characteristics produced by the research engine during volcanic ash ingestion and seeded fault insertion scenarios involving bleed air valves. Preliminary results indicate the successful acoustic detection of suspected degradation as a result of cumulative exposure to volcanic ash. This detection is shown through progressive changes, particularly in the high-frequency content, as a function of exposure to greater cumulative quantities of ash. Additionally, detection of the simulated failure of the 14th stage stability bleed valve and, to a lesser extent, the station 2.5 stability bleed valve, to their fully-open fail-safe positions was achieved by means of spectral comparisons between nominal (normal valve operation) and seeded fault scenarios. Detection of Motor Impairment in Parkinson's Disease Via Mobile Touchscreen Typing. Arroyo-Gallego, Teresa; Ledesma-Carbayo, Maria Jesus; Sanchez-Ferro, Alvaro; Butterworth, Ian; Mendoza, Carlos S; Matarazzo, Michele; Montero, Paloma; Lopez-Blanco, Roberto; Puertas-Martin, Veronica; Trincado, Rocio; Giancardo, Luca 2017-09-01 Mobile technology is opening a wide range of opportunities for transforming the standard of care for chronic disorders. Using smartphones as tools for longitudinally tracking symptoms could enable personalization of drug regimens and improve patient monitoring. Parkinson's disease (PD) is an ideal candidate for these tools. At present, evaluation of PD signs requires trained experts to quantify motor impairment in the clinic, limiting the frequency and quality of the information available for understanding the status and progression of the disease. Mobile technology can help clinical decision making by completing the information of motor status between hospital visits. This paper presents an algorithm to detect PD by analyzing the typing activity on smartphones independently of the content of the typed text. We propose a set of touchscreen typing features based on a covariance, skewness, and kurtosis analysis of the timing information of the data to capture PD motor signs. We tested these features, both independently and in a multivariate framework, in a population of 21 PD and 23 control subjects, achieving a sensitivity/specificity of 0.81/0.81 for the best performing feature and 0.73/0.84 for the best multivariate method. The results of the alternating finger-tapping, an established motor test, measured in our cohort are 0.75/0.78. This paper contributes to the development of a home-based, high-compliance, and high-frequency PD motor test by analysis of routine typing on touchscreens.

Detection and Classification of Motor Vehicle Noise in a Forested Landscape NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Brown, Casey L.; Reed, Sarah E.; Dietz, Matthew S.; Fristrup, Kurt M. 2013-11-01 Noise emanating from human activity has become a common addition to natural soundscapes and has the potential to harm wildlife and erode human enjoyment of nature. In particular, motor vehicles traveling along roads and trails produce high levels of both chronic and intermittent noise, eliciting varied responses from a wide range of animal species. Anthropogenic noise is especially conspicuous in natural areas where ambient background sound levels are low. In this article, we present an acoustic method to detect and analyze motor vehicle noise. Our approach uses inexpensive consumer products to record sound, sound analysis software to automatically detect sound events within continuous recordings and measure their acoustic properties, and statistical classification methods to categorize sound events. We describe an application of this approach to detect motor vehicle noise on paved, gravel, and natural-surface roads, and off-road vehicle trails in 36 sites distributed throughout a national forest in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA. These low-cost, unobtrusive methods can be used by scientists and managers to detect anthropogenic noise events for many potential applications, including ecological research, transportation and recreation planning, and natural resource management.

Detection of inter-turn faults in transformer winding using the capacitor discharge method NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Michna, Michał; Wilk, Andrzej; Ziółko, Michał; Wołoszyk, Marek; Swędrowski, Leon; Szwangruber, Piotr 2017-12-01 The paper presents results of an analysis of inter-turn fault effects on the voltage and current waveforms of a capacitor discharge through transformer windings. The research was conducted in the frame of the Facility of Antiproton and Ion Research project which goal is to build a new international accelerator facility that utilizes superconducting magnets. For the sake of electrical quality assurance of the superconducting magnet circuits, a measurement and diagnostic system is currently under development at Gdansk University of Technology (GUT). Appropriate measurements and simulations of the special transformer system were performed to verify the proposed diagnostic method. In order to take into account the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the magnetic yoke, a novel mathematical model of the transformer was developed. A special test bench was constructed to emulate the inter-turn faults within transformer windings. Fault detection technique for wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network using chaotic fiber laser NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Xu, Naijun; Yang, Lingzhen; Zhang, Juan; Zhang, Xiangyuan; Wang, Juanfen; Zhang, Zhaoxia; Liu, Xianglian 2014-03-01 We propose a fault localization method for wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON). A proof-of-concept experiment was demonstrated by utilizing the wavelength tunable chaotic laser generated from an erbium-doped fiber ring laser with a manual tunable fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) filter. The range of the chaotic lasing wavelength can cover the C-band. Basing on the TFBG filter, we can adjust the wavelength of the chaotic laser to match the WDM-PON channel with identical wavelength. We determined the fault location by calculating the cross-correlation between the reference and return signals. Analysis of the characteristics of the wavelength tunable chaotic laser showed that the breakpoint, the loose connector, and the mismatch connector could be precisely located. A dynamic range of approximately 23.8 dB and a spatial resolution of 4 cm, which was independent of the measuring range, were obtained.

Natural roller bearing fault detection by angular measurement of true instantaneous angular speed NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Renaudin, L.; Bonnardot, F.; Musy, O.; Doray, J. B.; Rémond, D. 2010-10-01 The challenge in many production activities involving large mechanical devices like power transmissions consists in reducing the machine downtime, in managing repairs and in improving operating time. Most online monitoring systems are based on conventional vibration measurement devices for gear transmissions or bearings in mechanical components. In this paper, we propose an alternative way of bearing condition monitoring based on the instantaneous angular speed measurement. By the help of a large experimental investigation on two different applications, we prove that localized faults like pitting in bearing generate small angular speed fluctuations which are measurable with optical or magnetic encoders. We also emphasize the benefits of measuring instantaneous angular speed with the pulse timing method through an implicit angular sampling which ensures insensitivity to speed fluctuation. A wide range of operating conditions have been tested for the two applications with varying speed, load, external excitations, gear ratio, etc. The tests performed on an automotive gearbox or on actual operating vehicle wheels also establish the robustness of the proposed methodology. By the means of a conventional Fourier transform, angular frequency channels kinematically related to the fault periodicity show significant magnitude differences related to the damage severity. Sideband effects are evidently seen when the fault is located on rotating parts of the bearing due to load modulation. Additionally, slip effects are also suspected to be at the origin of enlargement of spectrum peaks in the case of double row bearings loaded in a pure radial direction..

PMID:29354084 A novel micro-Raman technique to detect and characterize 4H-SiC stacking faults Piluso, N., E-mail: nicolo.piluso[USER].cnr.it; Camarda, M.; La Via, F.}), creating an electronic plasma that couples with the longitudinal optical (LO) Raman mode. The Raman shift of the LO phonon-plasmon-coupled mode (LOPC) increases as the free carrier density increases. Crystallographic defects lead to scattering or recombination of the free carriers which results in a loss of coupling with the LOPC, and in a reduction of the Raman shift. Given that the LOmore » phonon-plasmon coupling is obtained thanks to the free carriers generated by the high injection level induced by the laser, we named this technique induced-LOPC (i-LOPC). This technique allows the simultaneous determination of both the carrier lifetime and carrier mobility. Taking advantage of the modifications on the carrier lifetime induced by extended defects, we were able to determine the spatial morphology of stacking faults; the obtained morphologies were found to be in excellent agreement with those provided by standard photoluminescence techniques. The results show that the detection of defects via i-LOPC spectroscopy is totally independent from the stacking fault photoluminescence signals that cover a large energy range up to 0.7 eV, thus allowing for a single-scan simultaneous determination of any kind of stacking fault. Combining the i-LOPC method with the analysis of the transverse optical mode, the micro-Raman characterization can determine the most important properties of unintentionally doped film, including the stress status of the wafer, lattice impurities (point defects, polytype inclusions) and a detailed analysis of crystallographic defects, with a high spectral and spatial resolution.« less Fractal dimension and fuzzy logic systems for broken rotor bar detection in induction motors at start-up and steady-state regimes NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Amezquita-Sanchez, Juan P.; Valtierra-Rodriguez, Martin; Perez-Ramirez, Carlos A.; Camarena-Martinez, David; Garcia-Perez, Arturo; Romero-Troncoso, Rene J. 2017-07-01 Squirrel-cage induction motors (SCIMs) are key machines in many industrial applications. In this regard, the monitoring of their operating condition aiming at avoiding damage and reducing economical losses has become a demanding task for industry. In the literature, several techniques and methodologies to detect faults that affect the integrity and performance of SCIMs have been proposed. However, they have only been focused on analyzing either the start-up transient or the steady-state operation regimes, two common operating scenarios in real practice. In this work, a novel methodology for broken rotor bar (BRB) detection in SCIMs during both start-up and steady-state operation regimes is proposed. It consists of two main steps. In the first one, the analysis of three-axis vibration signals using fractal dimension (FD) theory is carried out. Since different FD-based algorithms can give different results, three algorithms named Katz’ FD, Higuchi’s FD, and box dimension, are tested. In the second step, a fuzzy logic system for each regime is presented for automatic diagnosis. To validate the proposal, a motor with different damage levels has been tested: one with a partially BRB, a second with one fully BRB, and the third with two BRBs. The obtained results demonstrate the proposed effectiveness. 3D seismic detection of shallow faults and fluid migration pathways offshore Southern Costa Rica: Application of neural-network meta-attributes NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Kluesner, J. W.; Silver, E. A.; Nale, S. M.; Bangs, N. L.; McIntosh, K. D. 2013-12-01 We employ a seismic meta-attribute workflow to detect and analyze probable faults and fluid-pathways in 3D within the sedimentary section offshore Southern Costa Rica. During the CRISP seismic survey in 2011 we collected an 11 x 55 km grid of 3D seismic reflection data and high-resolvability EM122 multibeam data, with coverage extending from the incoming plate to the outer-shelf. We mapped numerous seafloor seep indicators, with distributions ranging from the lower-slope to ~15 km landward of the shelf break [Kluesner et al., 2013, G3, doi:10.1002/ggge.20058; Silver et al., this meeting]. We used the OpendTect software package to calculate meta-attribute volumes from the 3D seismic data in order to detect and visualize seismic discontinuities in 3D. This methodology consists of dip-steered filtering to pre-condition the data, followed by combining a set of advanced dip-steered seismic attributes into a single object probability attribute using a user-trained neural-network pattern-recognition algorithm. The parameters of the advanced seismic attributes are set for optimal detection of the desired geologic discontinuity (e.g. faults or fluid-pathways). The product is a measure of probability for the desired target that ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the highest probability. Within the sedimentary section of the CRISP survey the results indicate focused fluid-migration pathways along dense networks of intersecting normal faults with approximately N-S and E-W trends. This pattern extends from the middle slope to the outer-shelf region. Dense clusters of fluid-migration pathways are located above basement highs and deeply rooted reverse faults [see Bangs et al., this meeting], including a dense zone of fluid-pathways imaged below IODP Site U1413. In addition, fault intersections frequently show an increased signal of fluid-migration and these zones may act as major conduits for fluid-flow through the sedimentary cover.

Escobar, R F; Astorga-Zaragoza, C M; Téllez-Anguiano, A C; Juárez-Romero, D; Hernández, J A; Guerrero-Ramírez, G V 2011-07-01 This paper deals with fault detection and isolation (FDI) in sensors applied to a concentric-pipe counter-flow heat exchanger. The proposed FDI is based on the analytical redundancy implementing nonlinear high-gain observers which are used to generate residuals when a sensor fault is presented (as software sensors). By evaluating the generated residual, it is possible to switch between the sensor and the observer when a failure is detected. Experiments in a heat exchanger pilot validate the effectiveness of the approach. The FDI technique is easy to implement allowing the industries to have an excellent alternative tool to keep their heat transfer process under supervision. The main contribution of this work is based on a dynamic model with heat transfer coefficients which depend on temperature and flow used to estimate the output temperatures of a heat exchanger. This model provides a satisfactory approximation of the states of the heat exchanger in order to allow its implementation in a FDI system used to perform supervision tasks. Copyright © 2011 ISA.

Spatial-Temporal Synchrophasor Data Characterization and Analytics in Smart Grid Fault Detection, Identification, and Impact Causal Analysis Jiang, Huaiguang; Dai, Xiaoxiao; Gao, David Wenzhong An approach of big data characterization for smart grids (SGs) and its applications in fault detection, identification, and causal impact analysis is proposed in this paper, which aims to provide substantial data volume reduction while keeping comprehensive information from synchrophasor measurements in spatial and temporal domains. Especially, based on secondary voltage control (SVC) and local SG observation algorithm, a two-layer dynamic optimal synchrophasor measurement devices selection algorithm (OSMDSA) is proposed to determine SVC zones, their corresponding pilot buses, and the optimal synchrophasor measurement devices. Combining the two-layer dynamic OSMDSA and matching pursuit decomposition, the synchrophasor data is completely characterized inmore » the spatial-temporal domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed characterization approach, SG situational awareness is investigated based on hidden Markov model based fault detection and identification using the spatial-temporal characteristics generated from the reduced data. To identify the major impact buses, the weighted Granger causality for SGs is proposed to investigate the causal relationship of buses during system disturbance. The IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system are employed to validate and evaluate the proposed approach.« less Fault detection of the connection of lithium-ion power batteries based on entropy for electric vehicles NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Yao, Lei; Wang, Zhenpo; Ma, Jun 2015-10-01 This paper proposes a method of fault detection of the connection of Lithium-Ion batteries based on entropy for electric vehicle. In electric vehicle operation process, some factors, such as road conditions, driving habits, vehicle performance, always affect batteries by vibration, which easily cause loosing or virtual connection between batteries. Through the simulation of the battery charging and discharging experiment under vibration environment, the data of voltage fluctuation can be obtained. Meanwhile, an optimal filtering method is adopted using discrete cosine filter method to analyze the characteristics of system noise, based on the voltage set when batteries are working under different vibration frequency. Experimental data processed by filtering is analyzed based on local Shannon entropy, ensemble Shannon entropy and sample entropy. And the best way to find a method of fault detection of the connection of lithium-ion batteries based on entropy is presented for electric vehicle. The experimental data shows that ensemble Shannon entropy can predict the accurate time and the location of battery connection failure in real time. Besides electric-vehicle industry, this method can also be used in other areas in complex vibration environment. Fault detection and isolation in GPS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring based on chaos particle swarm optimization-particle filter algorithm NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Wang, Ershen; Jia, Chaoying; Tong, Gang; Qu, Pingping; Lan, Xiaoyu; Pang, Tao 2018-03-01 The receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is one of the most important parts in an avionic navigation system. Two problems need to be addressed to improve this system, namely, the degeneracy phenomenon and lack of samples for the standard particle filter (PF). However, the number of samples cannot adequately express the real distribution of the probability density function (i.e., sample impoverishment). This study presents a GPS receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method based on a chaos particle swarm optimization particle filter (CPSO-PF) algorithm with a log likelihood ratio. The chaos sequence generates a set of chaotic variables, which are mapped to the interval of optimization variables to improve particle quality. This chaos perturbation overcomes the potential for the search to become trapped in a local optimum in the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Test statistics are configured based on a likelihood ratio, and satellite fault detection is then conducted by checking the consistency between the state estimate of the main PF and those of the auxiliary PFs. Based on GPS data, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect and isolate satellite faults under conditions of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Moreover, the performance of the proposed novel method is better than that of RAIM based on the PF or PSO-PF algorithm... A New Approach to Detect Mover Position in Linear Motors Using Magnetic Sensors Paul, Sarbajit; Chang, Junghwan 2015-01-01 A new method to detect the mover position of a linear motor is proposed in this paper. This method employs a simple cheap Hall Effect sensor-based magnetic sensor unit to detect the mover position of the linear motor. With the movement of the linear motor, Hall Effect sensor modules electrically separated 120° along with the idea of three phase balanced condition (va + vb + vc = 0) are used to produce three phase signals. The amplitude of the sensor output voltage signals are adjusted to unit amplitude to minimize the amplitude errors. With the unit amplitude signals three to two phase transformation is done to reduce the three multiples of harmonic components. The final output thus obtained is converted to position data by the use of arctangent function. The measurement accuracy of the new method is analyzed by experiments and compared with the conventional two phase method. Using the same number of sensor modules as the conventional two phase method, the proposed method gives more accurate position information compared to the conventional system where sensors are separated by 90° electrical angles.

Zhang, Zhi-Hui; Yang, Guang-Hong 2017-05-01 This paper provides a novel event-triggered fault detection (FD) scheme for discrete-time linear systems. First, an event-triggered interval observer is proposed to generate the upper and lower residuals by taking into account the influence of the disturbances and the event error. Second, the robustness of the residual interval against the disturbances and the fault sensitivity are improved by introducing l 1 and H ∞ performances. Third, dilated linear matrix inequalities are used to decouple the Lyapunov matrices from the system matrices. The nonnegative conditions for the estimation error variables are presented with the aid of the slack matrix variables. This technique allows considering a more general Lyapunov function. Furthermore, the FD decision scheme is proposed by monitoring whether the zero value belongs to the residual interval. It is shown that the information communication burden is reduced by designing the event-triggering mechanism, while the FD performance can still be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Copyright © 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. A joint resonance frequency estimation and in-band noise reduction method for enhancing the detectability of bearing fault signals NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Bozchalooi, I. Soltani; Liang, Ming 2008-05-01 The vibration signal measured from a bearing contains vital information for the prognostic and health assessment purposes. However, when bearings are installed as part of a complex mechanical system, the measured signal is often heavily clouded by various noises due to the compounded effect of interferences of other machine elements and background noises present in the measuring device. As such, reliable condition monitoring would not be possible without proper de-noising. This is particularly true for incipient bearing faults with very weak signature signals. A new de-noising scheme is proposed in this paper to enhance the vibration signals acquired from faulty bearings. This de-noising scheme features a spectral subtraction to trim down the in-band noise prior to wavelet filtering. The Gabor wavelet is used in the wavelet transform and its parameters, i.e., scale and shape factor are selected in separate steps. The proper scale is found based on a novel resonance estimation algorithm. This algorithm makes use of the information derived from the variable shaft rotational speed though such variation is highly undesirable in fault detection since it complicates the process substantially. The shape factor value is then selected by minimizing a smoothness index. This index is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the wavelet coefficient moduli. De-noising results are presented for simulated signals and experimental data acquired from both normal and faulty bearings with defective outer race, inner race, and rolling element. Robust sensor fault detection and isolation of gas turbine engines subjected to time-varying parameter uncertainties NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Pourbabaee, Bahareh; Meskin, Nader; Khorasani, Khashayar 2016-08-01 In this paper, a novel robust sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) strategy using the multiple model-based (MM) approach is proposed that remains robust with respect to both time-varying parameter uncertainties and process and measurement noise in all the channels. The scheme is composed of robust Kalman filters (RKF) that are constructed for multiple piecewise linear (PWL) models that are constructed at various operating points of an uncertain nonlinear system. The parameter uncertainty is modeled by using a time-varying norm bounded admissible structure that affects all the PWL state space matrices. The robust Kalman filter gain matrices are designed by solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) that are expressed as two linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility conditions. The proposed multiple RKF-based FDI scheme is simulated for a single spool gas turbine engine to diagnose various sensor faults despite the presence of parameter uncertainties, process and measurement noise. Our comparative studies confirm the superiority of our proposed FDI method when compared to the methods that are available in the literature. A Wearable Channel Selection-Based Brain-Computer Interface for Motor Imagery Detection. Lo, Chi-Chun; Chien, Tsung-Yi; Chen, Yu-Chun; Tsai, Shang-Ho; Fang, Wai-Chi; Lin, Bor-Shyh 2016-02-06 Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication interface between an external machine and the brain. Many kinds of spatial filters are used in BCIs to enhance the electroencephalography (EEG) features related to motor imagery. The approach of channel selection, developed to reserve meaningful EEG channels, is also an important technique for the development of BCIs. However, current BCI systems require a conventional EEG machine and EEG electrodes with conductive gel to acquire multi-channel EEG signals and then transmit these EEG signals to the back-end computer to perform the approach of channel selection. This reduces the convenience of use in daily life and increases the limitations of BCI applications. In order to improve the above issues, a novel wearable channel selection-based brain-computer interface is proposed. Here, retractable comb-shaped active dry electrodes are designed to measure the EEG signals on a hairy site, without conductive gel. By the design of analog CAR spatial filters and the firmware of EEG acquisition module, the function of spatial filters could be performed without any calculation, and channel selection could be performed in the front-end device to improve the practicability of detecting motor imagery in the wearable EEG device directly or in commercial mobile phones or tablets, which may have relatively low system specifications. Finally, the performance of the proposed BCI is investigated, and the experimental results show that the proposed system is a good wearable BCI system prototype. themore » reactive and schedule-based preventive maintenance commonly used today, when maintenance of RTUs is done at all.

A catastrophic failure, such as STS 51-L, resulted in the loss of both human life as well as expensive and unique hardware. The impact of this incident reaffirms the need to do everything possible to ensure the integrity and reliability of STS. One means of achieving this goal is to expand the number of inspection technologies available. Reported here is the evaluation of the use of modal analysis and test techniques for the purpose of assessing the structural integrity of STS components for which Marshall Space Flight Center has responsibility. This entailed reviewing existing literature and developing a low-level experimental program determine the feasibility of using this technology for structural fault detection.

Comparison of Fault Detection Algorithms for Real-time Diagnosis in Large-Scale System. Appendix E NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Kirubarajan, Thiagalingam; Malepati, Venkat; Deb, Somnath; Ying, Jie 2001-01-01 In this paper, we present a review of different real-time capable algorithms to detect and isolate component failures in large-scale systems in the presence of inaccurate test results. A sequence of imperfect test results (as a row vector of I's and O's) are available to the algorithms. In this case, the problem is to recover the uncorrupted test result vector and match it to one of the rows in the test dictionary, which in turn will isolate the faults. In order to recover the uncorrupted test result vector, one needs the accuracy of each test. That is, its detection and false alarm probabilities are required. In this problem, their true values are not known and, therefore, have to be estimated online. Other major aspects in this problem are the large-scale nature and the real-time capability requirement. Test dictionaries of sizes up to 1000 x 1000 are to be handled. That is, results from 1000 tests measuring the state of 1000 components are available. However, at any time, only 10-20% of the test results are available. Then, the objective becomes the real-time fault diagnosis using incomplete and inaccurate test results with online estimation of test accuracies. It should also be noted that the test accuracies can vary with time --- one needs a mechanism to update them after processing each test result vector. Using Qualtech's TEAMS-RT (system simulation and real-time diagnosis tool), we test the performances of 1) TEAMSAT's built-in diagnosis algorithm, 2) Hamming distance based diagnosis, 3) Maximum Likelihood based diagnosis, and 4) HidderMarkov Model based diagnosis.. Low power test architecture for dynamic read destructive fault detection in SRAM NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Takher, Vikram Singh; Choudhary, Rahul Raj 2018-06-01 Dynamic Read Destructive Fault (dRDF) is the outcome of resistive open defects in the core cells of static random-access memories (SRAMs). The sensitisation of dRDF involves either performing multiple read operations or creation of number of read equivalent stress (RES), on the core cell under test. Though the creation of RES is preferred over the performing multiple read operation on the core cell, cell dissipates more power during RES than during the read or write operation. This paper focuses on the reduction in power dissipation by optimisation of number of RESs, which are required to sensitise the dRDF during test mode of operation of SRAM. The novel pre-charge architecture has been proposed in order to reduce the power dissipation by limiting the number of RESs to an optimised number of two. The proposed low power architecture is simulated and analysed which shows reduction in power dissipation by reducing the number of RESs up to 18.18%.

Detection of small earthquakes with dense array data: example from the San Jacinto fault zone, southern California NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Meng, Haoran; Ben-Zion, Yehuda 2018-01-01 We present a technique to detect small earthquakes not included in standard catalogues using data from a dense seismic array. The technique is illustrated with continuous waveforms recorded in a test day by 1108 vertical geophones in a tight array on the San Jacinto fault zone. Waveforms are first stacked without time-shift in nine non-overlapping subarrays to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The nine envelope functions of the stacked records are then multiplied with each other to suppress signals associated with sources affecting only some of the nine subarrays. Running a short-term moving average/long-term moving average (STA/LTA) detection algorithm on the product leads to 723 triggers in the test day. Using a local P-wave velocity model derived for the surface layer from Betsy gunshot data, 5 s long waveforms of all sensors around each STA/LTA trigger are beamformed for various incident directions. Of the 723 triggers, 220 are found to have localized energy sources and 103 of these are confirmed as earthquakes by verifying their observation at 4 or more stations of the regional seismic network. This demonstrates the general validity of the method and allows processing further the validated events using standard techniques. The number of validated events in the test day is >5 times larger than that in the standard catalogue. Using these events as templates can lead to additional detections of many more earthquakes..

Wiegand, Thomas; Liao, Wei-Chih; Ong, Ta Chung; Däpp, Alexander; Cadalbert, Riccardo; Copéret, Christophe; Böckmann, Anja; Meier, Beat H 2017-11-01 DNP (dynamic nuclear polarization)-enhanced solid-state NMR is employed to directly detect protein-DNA and protein-ATP interactions and identify the residue type establishing the intermolecular contacts. While conventional solid-state NMR can detect protein-DNA interactions in large oligomeric protein assemblies in favorable cases, it typically suffers from low signal-to-noise ratios. We show here, for the oligomeric DnaB helicase from Helicobacter pylori complexed with ADP and single-stranded DNA, that this limitation can be overcome by using DNP-enhanced spectroscopy. Interactions are established by DNP-enhanced 31 P- 13 C polarization-transfer experiments followed by the recording of a 2D 13 C- 13 C correlation experiment. The NMR spectra were obtained in less than 2 days and allowed the identification of residues of the motor protein involved in nucleotide binding.

Application of a Subspace-Based Fault Detection Method to Industrial Structures NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Mevel, L.; Hermans, L.; van der Auweraer, H. 1999-11-01 Early detection and localization of damage allow increased expectations of reliability, safety and reduction of the maintenance cost. This paper deals with the industrial validation of a technique to monitor the health of a structure in operating conditions (e.g. rotating machinery, civil constructions subject to ambient excitations, etc.) and to detect slight deviations in a modal model derived from in-operation measured data. In this paper, a statistical local approach based on covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification is proposed. The capabilities and limitations of the method with respect to health monitoring and damage detection are discussed and it is explained how the method can be practically used in industrial environments. After the successful validation of the proposed method on a few laboratory structures, its application to a sports car is discussed. The example illustrates that the method allows the early detection of a vibration-induced fatigue problem of a sports car. In-situ fault detection apparatus and method for an encased energy storing device Hagen, Ronald A.; Comte, Christophe; Knudson, Orlin B.; Rosenthal, Brian; Rouillard, Jean 2000-01-01 An apparatus and method for detecting a breach in an electrically insulating surface of an electrically conductive power system enclosure within which a number of series connected energy storing devices are disposed. The energy storing devices disposed in the enclosure are connected to a series power connection. A detector is coupled to the series connection and detects a change of state in a test signal derived from the series connected energy storing devices. The detector detects a breach in the insulating layer of the enclosure by detecting a state change in the test signal from a nominal state to a non-nominal state. A voltage detector detects a state change of the test signals from a nominal state, represented by a voltage of a selected end energy storing device, to a non-nominal state, represented by a voltage that substantially exceeds the voltage of the selected opposing end energy storing device. Alternatively, the detector may comprise a signal generator that produces the test signal as a time-varying or modulated test signal and injects the test signal into the series connection. The detector detects the state change of the time-varying or modulated test signal from a nominal state, represented by a signal substantially equivalent to the test signal, to a non-nominal state, representative by an absence of the test signal. Detection and Classification of Transformer Winding Mechanical Faults Using UWB Sensors and Bayesian Classifier NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Alehosseini, Ali; A. Hejazi, Maryam; Mokhtari, Ghassem; B. Gharehpetian, Gevork; Mohammadi, Mohammad 2015-06-01 In this paper, the Bayesian classifier is used to detect and classify the radial deformation and axial displacement of transformer windings. The proposed method is tested on a model of transformer for different volumes of radial deformation and axial displacement. In this method, ultra-wideband (UWB) signal is sent to the simplified model of the transformer winding. The received signal from the winding model is recorded and used for training and testing of Bayesian classifier in different axial displacement and radial deformation states of the winding. It is shown that the proposed method has a good accuracy to detect and classify the axial displacement and radial deformation of the winding. Detecting Blind Fault with Fractal and Roughness Factors from High Resolution LiDAR DEM at Taiwan NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Cheng, Y. S.; Yu, T. T. 2014-12-01 There is no obvious fault scarp associated with blind fault. The traditional method of mapping this unrevealed geological structure is the cluster of seismicity. Neither the seismic event nor the completeness of cluster could be captured by network to chart the location of the entire possible active blind fault within short period of time. High resolution DEM gathered by LiDAR could denote actual terrain information despite the existence of plantation. 1-meter interval DEM of mountain region at Taiwan is utilized by fractal, entropy and roughness calculating with MATLAB code. By jointing these handing, the regions of non-sediment deposit are charted automatically. Possible blind fault associated with Chia-Sen earthquake at southern Taiwan is served as testing ground. GIS layer help in removing the difference from various geological formation, then multi-resolution fractal index is computed around the target region. The type of fault movement controls distribution of fractal index number. The scale of blind fault governs degree of change in fractal index. Landslide induced by rainfall and/or earthquake possesses larger degree of geomorphology alteration than blind fault; special treatment in removing these phenomena is required. Highly weathered condition at Taiwan should erase the possible trace remained upon DEM from the ru\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Grant Morrison, earlier this year Pádraig’s articles perhaps suggests there is a demand for such information however, and many of the comments certainly demonstrate a lack of adequate knowledge of the facts. Now who could possibly shine a light on this topic…? Ah, hang on, I know just the fella. Behold then, a remix edition of Alan Moore and Superfolks Part 3: The Strange Case of Grant Morrison and Alan Moore, where we cut and splice the original article – with Pádraig’s blessing I hasten to add! – with Grant Morrison’s own voice. Some bright hard fact-saliva, as one man would put it, and it is sorely needed. Whatever your stance on Moore, Morrison-bashing is rather rife, and quite unfair when you are aware of both sides of the story. As to my own credentials, I have interviewed both men more than once in the past, and enjoy many of the works of both, but have had very different experiences with the two men on both a personal and professional level. I freely admit then my bias towards Morrison, as Pádraig does for Moore. But enough of me, let’s get on with the remix. All Grant’s words are in red font for ease of reading: Hope the following rather massive info-dump helps clarify a few things. I also hope this may explain why I’ve sometimes felt myself to be the victim of a genuine grudge that seems quite staggering in its sincerity and longevity. Reading the comments section following “The Strange Case of Alan Moore and Grant Morrison” I can’t help but note how heavily my detractors rely on a total lack of research, gross distortions of historical fact, and playground name-calling to support their alleged points. Not that I expect this to make much difference but the opportunity to separate fact from fantasy is a welcome one. Pádraig quotes from Alan Moore discussing me during a webchat earlier this year without challenging even the most obvious and basic of the many historical inaccuracies and contradictions in Moore’s assertions. In fact, Moore’s recollections are completely unreliable and I wouldn’t mind having some facts put on record, once and for all. Thanks to Pádraig for allowing me to respond directly to his piece and to Laura for bringing it to my attention and offering me space on The Beat to get some things off my medal-heavy chest. Originally, when I set out to look into the various allegations about Alan Moore and Robert Mayer’s Superfolks, I thought it was going to be a comparatively straightforward piece to write. Just read the book, find out what people had said, and attempt to match the two of them up together. What could be easier, I asked myself? Ten thousand words and nearly a year later, I find that I could not have been more wrong. However, doing the research is at least half the fun, I’ve always said. Much of the fascination of writing about things like this is that you never know what you’re going to find out. And one of the things that I found out was that I really needed to know more about the animosity between Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, as it seemed to be a constantly recurring aspect of the story of Moore and Superfolks. So, to go back to where I started, back to the beginning of the piece called Alan Moore and Superfolks: Part 1 – The Case for the Prosecution, there’s that piece from Grant Morrison’s Drivel column in Speakeasy (July 1990), where he talks about reading Superfolks, and makes it really quite clear that he thinks – or pretends to think – that Alan Moore plundered the book for ideas. But this isn’t by any means the beginning of their – for want of a better word – relationship. But what is the beginning of that relationship? There are two different versions of this, depending on who you listen to. Not entirely. One “version” is supported by incontrovertible facts and verifiable research. The other relies on demonstrable errors. Beginning with the latter - So, first there’s Alan Moore’s version of events, which I’ve transcribed from the webchat he did for the Harvey Pekar statue Kickstarter. One of the questioners asked, You are somewhat surprisingly not the only acclaimed comics writer from the UK to also be a vocal magician. Obviously I’m talking about Grant Morrison here, who has never been terribly shy about his views on you or your work. Can we possibly draw you out on your views of him and his work? To which Moore replied, Well, let me see… The reason I haven’t spoken about Grant Morrison generally is because I’m not very interested in him, and I don’t really want to get involved with a writer of his calibre in some sort of squabble. But, for the record, since you asked: the first time I met him, he was an aspiring comics writer from Glasgow, I was up there doing a signing or something. They asked if I could perhaps – if they could invite a local comics writer who was a big admirer of mine along to the dinner. So I said yeah. This was I think the only time that I met him to speak to. He said how much he admired my work, how it had inspired him to want to be a comics writer. And I wished him the best of luck, I told him I’d look out for his work. When I saw that work in 2000 AD I thought ‘Well, this seems as if it’s a bit of a cross between Captain Britain and Marvelman, but that’s probably something that he’ll grow out of.’ - Let’s start with “an aspiring writer…” The usually well-informed Moore’s grasp of the facts is a little shaky here but the truth is well documented and, as can be quickly verified, my first professionally published comic book work “Time Is A Four-Letter Word” appeared in the independent adult sci-fi comic “Near Myths” in October 1978 (written and drawn by me, the story was/is, amusingly enough, based around the simultaneity of time concept Alan Moore himself is so fond of these days and which informs his in-progress novel “Jerusalem”). By 1979, I was also contributing stories on a regular basis to DC Thomson’s ‘Starblazer’ series and I’d begun a three year stint writing and drawing ‘Captain Clyde’, a weekly half-page newspaper strip about a lo-fi “realistic” Glasgow superhero. “Captain Clyde” ran in three newspapers. I was even a guest on panels at comics conventions. In October 1978, Alan Moore had sold one illustration – a drawing of Elvis Costello to NME – and had not yet achieved any recognition in the comics business. In 1979, he was doing unpaid humour cartoons for the underground paper “The Back Street Bugle”. I didn’t read his name in a byline until 1982, by which time I’d been a professional writer for almost five years. Using the miracle of computer technology, you can verify any of these dates right now, if you choose to. It’s true that Moore’s work in “Warrior” and “The Daredevils”, combined with the rising excitement of the early ’80s comics boom in Britain, galvanized me into refocusing and taking my existing comics career more seriously at a time (1982) when the music career I’d tried to pursue was spinning in circles but I hope even the most devoted of his readers might understand why I’ve grown tired of the widely-accepted, continually-reinforced belief that Moore’s work either predated my own or that he inspired or encouraged me to enter the comics field when it’s hardly a chore to fact-check the relevant publication dates. So I’ll repeat until maybe one day it sticks; I was already a professional writer/artist in the late ’70s, doing work-for-hire at DC Thomson alongside “creator-owned” sci-fi and superhero comics. This was at the same time as people like Bryan Talbot, Peter Milligan, Brendan McCarthy, and Brett Ewins, making us some of the earliest exemplars of the British new wave. If Alan Moore had never come along, if he’d given up halfway through his ground-breaking turn on “St. Pancras Panda”, we would all still have written and drawn our comics. We published our own fanzines, and small press outlets were popping up everywhere. “2000 AD” was at a peak. Marvel UK was in a period of expansion and innovation.. - It was on that basis that I recommended him to Karen Berger when she was starting [indecipherable speech – Vertigo?]. - It’s hard not to be a little insulted by Moore’s comments that he recommended me to Karen Berger for, what he has described on more than one occasion, and with a fairly extravagant degree of solipsistic self-regard, as a “proposed Alan Moore farm with Vertigo Comics”, seemingly unable to imagine veteran writers like Peter Milligan, me and others as anything more than extensions of his own self-image. See here- - or here - However, as five minutes research will confirm, the Vertigo imprint was established in 1993, by which time Alan Moore had fallen out with DC over the “For Mature Readers” ratings system and quit doing new work for them (I believe his split with DC occurred in 1987). I had already been working there for six years doing “Animal Man”, “Doom Patrol”, “Arkham Asylum”, “Gothic”, “Hellblazer” and “Kid Eternity”. I had a good relationship with Karen Berger and was a fairly obvious choice for her to call when she conceived the Vertigo imprint. No other recommendation was necessary. It ought to go without saying that none of us were told to write like Alan Moore – nor did we – and that this is an out-and-out lie. Far more significantly, much of the material that fed into early Vertigo was originated by the creators and by Editor Art Young for the proposed Touchmark imprint of creator-owned adult comics he’d been assigned to put together under the aegis of Disney, of all things. Coincidentally gay-themed series like Peter Milligan’s “Enigma” and my own “Sebastian 0″ – which actually grew out of a pitch for a revamp of IPC’s “Janus Stark” character – were commissioned by Art for publication at Touchmark, not by Karen Berger. When Touchmark experienced a failure to launch, Art was re-hired by DC and brought his portfolio of projects to Vertigo. At no point was Alan Moore involved in any of this. Again, why the fibs, other than to reinforce once more the fantasy of me – and indeed every other Vertigo writer – in a junior or subordinate position to himself? As Moore points out, the work I did on “Zenith” 25 years ago can trace a little – not all – of its influence to “Marvelman” and “Captain Britain” both of which I loved; my own introduction to the first volume of “Zenith”, published in 1988, admits as much, while also listing the book’s many other touchstones. - Then there started a kind of, a strange campaign of things in fanzines where he was expressing his opinions of me, as you put it. He later explained this as saying that when he started writing, he felt that he wasn’t famous enough, and that a good way of becoming famous would be to say nasty things about me. Which I suppose is a tactic – although not one that, of course, I’m likely to appreciate. So at that point I decided, after I’d seen a couple of his things and they seemed incredibly derivative, I just decided to stop bothering reading his work. And that’s largely sort of proven successful. But, there still seems to be this kind of [indecipherable speech] that I know. - I don’t believe I ever tried to get “famous” by insulting Alan Moore. It doesn’t seem the most likely route to celebrity. The commercial work I was doing in the early 1980s wasn’t much like the kind of material I wrote and drew for myself, or for indie publication.. I also did a good Chris Claremont and a semi-passable Douglas Adams. My personal work from the same time is written in a very different style, and is more in the vein of ‘Doom Patrol’ or ‘The Invisibles’. You don’t have to take my word for this: it can be verified by looking at the ‘Near Myths’ material or stuff like the “Famine” strip in “Food For Thought” from 1985. It can even be gleaned by looking at the clear difference between the first four “Animal Man” issues and the fifth – “The Coyote Gospel” story Pádraig mentions – and subsequent issues. Doing my own approximation of the “in” style to get gigs on Marvel UK books was, I thought, a demonstration of my range, versatility and adaptability to trends, not the declaration of some singular influence it has subsequently been distorted into over four decades – mostly by Alan Moore and his supporters, in what can sometimes feel like a never-ending campaign to undermine my personal achievements and successes and to cast me, at all times, in a subsidiary role to the Master. Furthermore to suggest, as Moore does, that subsequent work of mine, including the balance of “Animal Man”, “Doom Patrol”, “Flex Mentallo”, “JLA”, “The Invisibles”, “New X-Men”, “Seven Soldiers”, “Batman”, “All-Star Superman” etc. was equally indebted to “Captain Britain” and “Marvelman” means either one of two things: that he’s read the work in question and is again deliberately distorting the facts for reasons known only to himself – or that he hasn’t read it at all, in which case he’s in no position to comment surely? (I do know that Alan Moore has read a lot more of my work than he pretends to – one of his former collaborators quite innocently revealed as much to me a few years ago, confirming my own suspicions – but until Moore himself comes clean about it that will have to remain in the realm of hearsay.) - And, as far as I know, he’s the only bone of contention between me and Michael Moorcock. Michael Moorcock is a sweet sweet man – I believe he has only ever written one letter of complain to a publisher over the appropriation of his work, that was to DC Comics over Grant Morrison, so the only bone of contention between me and Michael Moorcock is which of us Grant Morrison is ripping off the most. I say that it’s Michael Moorcock, he says it’s me. We’ve nearly come to blows over it, but I’m reluctant to let it go that far, because, I’m probably more nimble than Moorcock – I’ve got a few years on him, I’m probably faster, but Moorcock is huge, he’s like a bear. He could just like take my arm off with one sweep of his paw, so we’ll let that go undecided for the moment. But, those are pretty much my thoughts on Grant Morrison, and hopefully now I’ve explained that I won’t have to mention his name again. Why would he feel qualified, on the basis of the “couple” of things of mine he claims to have read a long time ago, to insist that not only do I rip him off on a regular basis but his friend Michael Moorcock too? Can anyone tell me from which Michael Moorcock novels “Zenith” and “Animal Man” were plagiarized? (And if Moorcock made any complaints to DC in the ’90s, I never heard about them. I had no idea there was any beef with Moorcock until Pop Image’s Jonathan Ellis drew my attention to it in 2004). As an important aside in this discussion, Moorcock’s spurious allegations of creative theft are based on exactly TEN pages of material in issues 17-19 of “The Invisibles”. These pages were explicitly presented as a Moorcock pastiche – or more strictly a pastiche of my own Gideon Stargrave stories from “Near Myths”, which were heavily but not entirely influenced by Moorcock and J.G Ballard – occurring in the head of the fictional character King Mob. King Mob actually talks about his obsession with Jerry Cornelius within the story and I reference Moorcock’s work as an inspiration for these pages in the letters column of issue 17. Not content with deliberately misinterpreting a mere ten pages of my fifteen hundred page comic series, Moorcock – this “sweet, sweet man” – continues to this day to jeer and spit abuse. Here’s Alan Moore’s mate Michael Moorcock – - describing me as “a sticky-fingered tea leaf” (!) and talking about having me “duffed over”. “I’ve read the work of Grant Morrison twice. Once when I wrote it. Once when he wrote it. As far as I’m concerned my image of Grant Morrison is of someone wearing a mask, a flat hat and a striped jersey and carrying a bag marked SWAG.” Sexy! Leaving aside his own appropriation of entire swathes of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Harry Blyth, Moorcock fails to convince that he’s read any aspect of my “work” even once, let alone twice. He has so far failed to back up the casual slander with any actual evidence or examples of when he found the time to write “The Invisibles”, “St. Swithin’s Day”, “The New Adventures of Hitler”, “We3″, “The Filth”, “Kill Your Boyfriend”, “Mystery Play”, “Seaguy” or “Joe the Barbarian” to name just a few. In a 34-year career, I’ve also written long-running DC and Marvel series, plays, screenplays, video games, short stories and a book; all of which, if Michael Moorcock is to be believed, were written by him. Except for the bits I stole from Alan Moore! Allow me to demonstrate how easy it is to play this dangerous game: I’ll start by pointing out how various interviews in which I talked about my practice of Chaos Magic during the 1980s and early ’90s clearly played into Alan Moore’s decision to declare himself a magician in 1993. Next, with censorious authority, I’ll point to my own “Doom Patrol” and claim it gave him the idea for his “1963” project at Image, released a year later. I’ll suggest that Moore’s take on “Supreme” was a lot more like my take on “Animal Man” than “Zenith” was like “Marvelman” or “Captain Britain” – The Supremacy in “Supreme” is a fairly blatant copy of the Comic Book Limbo concept I introduced in “Animal Man” seven years earlier and the Moore book’s wider meta-fictional concerns also covered territory well-trodden by “Animal Man”. “LOEG: Century” with its apocalypse/moonchild plot occurring over three time periods cannot help but recall the apocalypse/moonchild plotline running over three time periods in “The Invisibles” fifteen years previously – with Orlando playing the Lord Fanny role, if you fancy. I could go on and on here, with “convincing” examples, but you get the idea. I’ll wind up with some condescending comment about how I figured he’d grow out of the rip-off magic and metafiction nonsense then wryly conclude that there’s not much chance of that now he’s nudging 60. The above is at least as plausible as Alan Moore’s outlandish attempts to claim that my entire career rests on two stories he wrote 30 years ago. As Ed Brubaker pointed out in the comments section of Part 2 of Pádraig’s series of articles, all writers are influenced by all kinds of things, including one another, all the time. The wider issues around plagiarism, influence, ownership and appropriation – especially in the context of the “IP”-driven corporate vision of creativity – are definitely worth further discussion but I’d like to keep this narrowed down to Pádraig’s essay and specifically Alan Moore’s comments about me. However, as evidence that I’m not alone before the jury, Moore has charged and found guilty the entire mainstream comics industry of living off his leftovers for 30 years here - - and in other interviews which relentlessly position his own oeuvre as the source of all our Niles. No-one would begrudge him his own obvious influences if he didn’t feel compelled to lecture the rest of us from a moral high ground he occupies dishonestly - Moore includes Geoff Johns among the “parasites” and “raccoons” rooting through his trash. Why? Because Johns seasoned his own epic expansion of the Green Lantern mythos with a couple of minor elements from Moore’s Green Lantern short story “Tygers” (1986) – a story that was itself created to make sense of a plot hole in the 1959 Green Lantern origin by Gardner Fox! So, in fact, both Moore and Johns were simply doing their work-for-hire jobs by adding to and expanding upon the many-authored quilt that is DC, and specifically Green Lantern, continuity. In a shared narrative universe, such as those of DC or Marvel, any element introduced into the continuity surely becomes part of the backstory and is therefore available to other writers to build upon or incorporate. Johns’ Green Lantern work and the “Blackest Night” story in particular would have worked as well without any reference to “Tygers”, in fact. Why the sneering, dehumanizing putdown? Who chastises a man for the unspeakable crime of synthesizing prior elements of Green Lantern’s back story into his own fresh and personal creative vision for the character, m’lud? Would Moore have appreciated a comparison to vermin snuffling among Gardner Fox’s garbage for treats when he brought Fox’s Floronic Man back from the archives to feature in a “Swamp Thing” (Len Wein’s trash!) story? What obsessive snouting around in the municipal tip does “League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” reduce to if we regard Alan Moore’s endeavours through the same unforgiving lens he applies to Geoff Johns’ work? Geoff Johns like the rest of us, has his own identifiable obsessions as a writer. He has his own interests, his own points of view, and his own way of articulating his ideas via his chosen medium. I know for a fact that Geoff has seen and done and endured things in his life that Alan Moore is unlikely ever to experience, yet Moore automatically brands him creatively bankrupt and tries to insists that Johns’ imagination is so low on fuel, it relies for sustenance on his own. If I can speak up for a friend, Geoff Johns, like the rest of us, like anyone who picks up a pen to earn a living, has plenty to say and, with all respect, he doesn’t need Alan Moore’s help to say it. Excuse the fit of editorializing there. It had to happen. Let’s return to the facts in this “Strange Case” - The other version of the story comes from Patrick Meaney’s Talking with Gods documentary, where Morrison says, I remember reading V for Vendetta and thinking, this is what I wanted to do, this is the way comics should be. One of the first things I did was go down to see Dez Skinn in London, the publisher of Warrior I had taking this story, which was a Kid Marvelman spec script, and he bought it straight away so, again, that was a really good jump for me. Then Alan Moore had it spiked, and said it was never to be published. Thus began our slight antagonism, which has persisted until this very day. They asked me to continue Marvelman because Moore had fallen out with everyone in the magazine, and taken away his script, and they said ‘Would you follow this up?’ And to me that was just like, oh my God – the idea of getting to do Marvelman, following Alan Moore, ‘I’m the only person in the world who’d really do this right,’ and I was well up for it. I didn’t want to do it without Moore’s permission, and I wrote to him and said, ‘They, ‘I don’t want this to sound like the softly hissed tones of a mafia hitman, but back off.’ And the letter was all, ‘but you can’t do this,’ you know, ‘we’re much more popular than you, and if you do this, your career will be over,’ and it was really quite threatening, you know, so I didn’t do it, but I ended up doing some little bit of work for Warrior. It’s hard to put exact dates on either of these versions, but presumably Moore’s story happened before Morrison’s, and, given that Morrison’s story refers to Moore having stopped writing Marvelman for Warrior this puts the date at some point between August 1984, when Moore’s last Marvelman story appeared, in Warrior , and February 1985, when Warrior , the last issue, came out, – containing the Morrison-scripted “The Liberators: Night Moves” incidentally. So the meeting in Glasgow between Moore and Morrison must have happened at some point between the first issue of Warrior in March 1982 and Moore’s last story, in August 1984. The exact timing in possibly not that important, but I like to nail these things down if I can! The timing is very important because Moore met me not once but many times – the first at a comic mart in Glasgow’s McLellan Galleries (in ’83, I think) when I gave him a copy of my music fanzine “Bombs Away Batman!” which contained positive reviews of his strips in “Warrior” and “2000AD”. The second time was at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow in 1984 where I recommended William McIllvaney’s “Laidlaw” novels to him. On both occasions, and whatever he may have thought then or now, I was not an ‘aspiring writer’ but a many times published one, as can easily be checked. In the company of Bryan Talbot, I spoke briefly with Moore again at a comic convention in Birmingham in 1986, by which time we had corresponded on the subject of “Marvelman”, and when we met for a fourth time at the dinner he semi-recalls (in Glasgow during the “Watchmen” Graphitti Editions tour in 1987, when he and Dave Gibbons signed a copy of their book for my mum), I was a full-time professional, working for “2000 AD” – and DC too by that point – not an aspiring writer (I also met and spoke with him after that – the last time we were in a room together was at the Angouleme comics festival in 1990 but by then he would no longer communicate with me, even by semaphore). When Moore says “They asked if I could perhaps – if they could invite a local comics writer who was a big admirer of mine along to the dinner.”, the careful, self-aggrandizing, phrasing suggests not only that Moore had no idea who I was but that some special privilege had been accorded me when, in fact, the meal was organized by John McShane, who ran AKA Books and Comics in Glasgow at the time. I spent two afternoons a week hanging around John’s shop talking comics, and as a friend and a fellow professional who knew Moore and respected his work, he naturally invited me along to the dinner as a guest. This mysterious “local comics writer” was, in fact, someone Alan Moore knew, had met, and had even exchanged letters with previously, as outlined above. A fellow professional, in fact. I remember talking to him about becoming a vegetarian – ‘sometimes you can’t live with the contradictions, Grant’… – which suggests I’d started work on “Animal Man”. I kept detailed diaries from 1978 – 93 and I can check the exact dates but “Arkham Asylum” was also written in 1987. I was far from up-and-coming at the point in time Moore cites.Why the made-up stories about me? Meanwhile, Morrison’s own star was on the rise. He started writing Zenith for 2000 AD in August 1987, after various other work here and there in UK comics, and this was his breakthrough work. I didn’t come across him myself until later on, when he was writing Animal Man for DC Comics, and still think that The Coyote Gospel from Animal Man is one of the single best things ever put on a page, by anyone. It was during this time that Morrison, as Moore put it, had ‘a strange campaign of things in fanzines where he was expressing his opinions of me […]. He later explained this as saying that when he started writing, he felt that he wasn’t famous enough, and that a good way of becoming famous would be to say nasty things about me’ Morrison himself refers to this too, in his book Supergods where he says, High-contrast Western manga art by my Zoids partner Steve Yeowell made Zenith’s world a frantic modernist blur of speed lines and contemporary fashions and haircuts. We announced to the world that Zenith was intended to be as dumb, sexy, and disposable as an eighties pop single: Alan Moore remixed by Stock Aitken Waterman. Keeping all the self-awareness outside the story, we used interviews and forewords to admit to our sources. In them we praised creative theft and plagiarism, quoted the French playwright Antonin Artaud and sneeringly suggested that the likes of Watchmen were pompous, stuffy, and buttock-clenchingly dour. The shock tactics I’d brought with me from the music world, delivered with the snotty whippet-thin snideness of the hipster, had helped me carve out a niche for myself as comics’ enfant terrible, and Steve was happy to play along as the handsome nice one with nothing controversial to say. My public persona was punk to the rotten core. Outspoken and mean spirited, I freely expressed contempt for the behind-the-scenes world of comics professionals, which seemed unglamorous and overwhelmingly masculine by comparison to the club and music scenes. My life was rich, and my circle of friends and family was secure enough that I could afford to play a demonic role at work. Reading interviews from the time makes my blood run cold these days, but the trash talk seemed to be working, and I was rapidly making a name for myself. Being young, good-looking, and cocky forgave many sins, a huge hit British superhero strip did the rest and proved I could back up the big talk Talking about this more recently, in David Bishop’s Thrill-Power Overload: Thirty Years of 2000 AD (Rebellion, UK, June 2007), – Sorry to interrupt here, but an interview from 2007 can’t have appeared “more recently” than the extract from “Supergods”, published in 2011, without the aid of string theory. – Morrison recalls being asked by the editorial people at 2000 AD to come up with an idea for a British superhero strip, he said, [Zenith] was very much a reaction against torment superheroes. Dark Knight is a brilliant piece of Reagan-era fiction and Watchmen is very, very clever in its architecture, but both books felt pompous and concept albumy to me as a young man in the 80s. I wanted to do something a little less self conscious perhaps, or to align myself with a different current of thinking. I had grown bored with the dull ‘realism’ of the grim ‘n’ gritty school. Brendan [McCarthy]’s work was so unique, so personal and inspirational that I was completely blown away and converted utterly to the McCarthy method – tell the truth on to the page and let your psyche all hang out. At the same time… I wanted some ‘realistic’ aspects to my story. I decided to make it about the superficial things I was into at the time: clothes, records, TV shows. Instead of creating an aspirational superhero, I gave Zenith all of my worst, most venal traits. I wanted to create a postcard from the 80s, but I also thought that if I did it without the prevailing captions and thought boxes the strip might stand up quite well on its own. My own opinion of what happened, and how I feel about it, has changed quite a bit since I started writing these three pieces. Yes, I have a lot of sympathy for Alan Moore about the things that were being said about him, but I think that it’s pretty obvious there was more than an element of the japester, the trickster, about Morrison’s writing, in particular the piece he wrote about Superfolks in his Drivel column in Speakeasy in 1990, which he makes all the more obvious in his end piece. Context! There was more than just an “…element of the japester, the trickster…” to “Drivel”. As may be deduced from one or all of the following clues: - the title. The accompanying photograph of me sneering, stripped to the waist wearing a rather pretty necklace, and flipping a ‘V’-sign. Photo Used in Drivel Column The over-the-top, bitchy and camp style of the writing – - “Drivel” was a monthly, scurrilous, humour, gossip, and opinion column in “Speakeasy”, the leading British comics magazine in 1990 when the piece in question was written. I had a brief from my editor Stuart Greene and I mostly stuck to it, except when I used “Drivel” to indulge in William Burroughs-style “cut-up” experiments. My fee for the column went to Blue Cross, so all that manufactured bile wasn’t wasted and helped make the lives of some rescue animals a little more comfortable on a monthly basis. Otherwise, the persona I adopted for “Drivel” was an exaggerated caricature partly inspired by the Morrissey interviews I enjoyed reading. The whole point of the column – which was one of the magazine’s most popular features, incidentally – was to take the piss out of the comics scene at the time. Alan Moore was only one of the many, many targets of “Drivel” and he came off lightly in comparison to some others – with whom I am still on friendly terms. The main target of the satire in “Drivel” was myself and if anyone’s reputation has suffered as a result of people in other lands and different times presenting as indictable some daft words written in jest, I’d suggest it’s been mine. In defense of my 30 year old self, he had an editorial mandate to amuse and provoke, unlike the 59 year old Alan Moore who insults, condemns and hurls baseless accusations at his contemporaries and their work in almost every interview he gives.. Does he ever, for instance, use his high media profile to do anything other than steer potential readers away from modern comic books and their creators – while over-playing his own achievements and placing himself centre stage at every turn? How hard would it be to say something encouraging, positive, or hopeful about the generally improved standard of writing in all comic books these days? Or at least say nothing at all. And if I may untangle the logic behind so much of his hectoring: Moore constantly reiterates the idea that all modern comics are copied from stuff he did in the ’80s – and they’re all rubbish! Is he genuinely saying that his influence has been entirely malignant? If he actually believed that, I’d almost feel sorry for him. I see my own influence all over the place and I’m quite chuffed. I’d also like to point out that that was over twenty years ago now, a long time to have something like that hanging over you, and this applies equally to both of them: Moore is still having it used as a stick to beat him with, and Morrison may wish that a not-terribly-serious piece he wrote as a young man, and which has cast a much longer shadow than anyone could ever have expected, would simply go away. (And, indeed, having someone like me digging it up one more time can hardly help in that, although I’m hoping that this might get to be the final, and definitive, word on the subject…) I also imagine that having someone get in touch to offer to take over writing his first major piece of work probably wasn’t received terribly well, and it’s hard to blame Moore for that, either. For a broader picture of what was happening with Alan Moore and “Warrior” at the time, I suggest asking Alan Davis (another on Moore’s list of excommunicated former collaborators) or Dez Skinn for their recollections. I’m sure it’ll be in one of those George Khoury books about Marvelman. I wasn’t part of all that. But in many ways Morrison was only doing what Moore had done before him. I can certainly recognise the punk spirit in some of what Morrison says – I’m less than 100 days older than Morrison, and I do recall that rule in punk was that everything that went before was rubbish. In hindsight, of course, there is much that was discarded that has since been reappraised, and found not to be so dreadful after all! In much the same way, when Morrison says, ‘Reading interviews from the time makes my blood run cold these days’, I imagine that one of the things he’s particularly referring to is his treatment of Moore in those early articles. My blood runs cold because I am no longer a young man but an increasingly decrepit 52 year old with a lot less arrogance, a lot more life experience, and a bit more compassion for people, even the ones I don’t particularly like. With the wisdom of hindsight, I wish I could tell my younger self that in the future, no matter how much he thought he’d changed or matured, “Drivel” would always return. These days, if I aim a barb at Moore, and I sometimes do, it’s generally as revenge for having my attention drawn to some latest interview or other. I know there’s a lot more to him than the contemptuous, patronising Scorpionic mask – we’re all just people and we all do the same daft people shit and all that – but it’s the face I’ve been exposed to more often than not, so I’m afraid my view of Alan Moore has a somewhat negative bias that deepens every time he opens his mouth to preach hellfire and damnation on the comics business and its benighted labour force. Having said that, I learned long ago to separate my antipathy toward the man’s expressed opinions from my enjoyment of his work and I’ve been very complimentary about that work over the decades. Conversely, I can guarantee you will search in vain for a single positive comment about me or my work coming from Alan Moore’s direction – in spite of our obvious shared areas of interest. I certainly think that Morrison may now regret some of his earlier actions but, particularly in this Internet age, nothing is gone, and everything is remembered. It is interesting, I think, that in his book Supergods - which itself seems to actually reflect the title of Superfolks - he doesn’t actually mention Superfolks in relation to his or Moore’s work, but in the context of having been an inspiration for Pixar’s The Incredibles Even so, Supergods has the line “Behold, I teach you the superman: He is this lightning, he is this madness!” by Friedrich Nietzsche as its epigraph, the same as Superfolks did, and Marvelman didn’t. Is this all some sort of strange cosmic coincidence, or is Morrison trying to tell us something? Honestly, I have no idea. The structure of “Supergods” is roughly based on the Qabalistic idea of the “Lightning Flash” – the zig-zagging magician’s path from the lowest material sphere of Malkuth/the material world via the various sephiroth or spheres to the highest spiritual sphere known as Kether in this system. In the same way, the book moves from the earthy foundations of the early chapters, with their focus on physicality, to the speculations, philosophies and “higher” considerations of the concluding chapters. I chose this structure for a couple of obvious reasons – firstly, because the superhero as a figure unites the mundane and the divine and secondly because every time a new “age” of comics was said to begin, I noted that it tended to be announced by a superhero wearing a lightning bolt insignia, or descended from one (as Marvelman from Captain Marvel), or came with iconic references to lightning, thunderbolts and electricity. My favourite superhero is The Flash and his emblem is a stylized, simplified echo of the right-to-left zapping course of the Qabala flash. I was very aware of the irony of re-using that hoary old Nietzsche quote but there was, quite simply, no more apposite epigraph for “Supergods”, I hope you’ll agree. The title of the book, by the way, is not a reference to “Superfolks” but to David Bowie’s song “The Supermen” which includes the lines “and supergod dies…”. So, what do I think, in the end? I think, first, that, although Grant Morrison poked fun at Alan Moore with regard to Superfolks he certainly didn’t mean it to be taken as seriously as it was, or for it to become a big stick to beat Moore with. Pádraig will need to offer more convincing evidence that my 1990 “Speakeasy” column has done the slightest harm to Alan Moore’s sales or his reputation. I’ll wager that less than 2% of the readers of “Watchmen” – still the world’s best-selling graphic novel – have heard of “Superfolks”, let alone “Speakeasy” or “Drivel” (although the proportion is likely to rise if people keep drawing attention to this very minor issue – currently it’s an item on MTV Geek). As I’ve said, it’s far easier to make the argument that Moore, along with powerful allies like Michael Moorcock, continues to indulge in clear, persistent, and often successful attempts to injure my reputation, for reasons of his own. And I really think it’s a shame that Alan Moore has such difficulty moving on from things like this, because he’s done his own share of saying mean things about Morrison, to this day. I genuinely love Moore’s work, and one of the things I love most is the sense of compassion, of redemption, that is in much of it, but reading over these pieces, it’s hard not to see Moore as the one who is perpetuating this, rather than Morrison, who only ever has good things to say about Moore’s work these days. It’s not that I don’t think that Moore has good reason to do the things he does, just that it can be difficult sometimes to see that your gods have feet of clay. In the end, though, I still love his work, and still admire him enormously as a person and as a creator. I don’t read as much of Grant Morrison’s work as I used to, mostly because I finally decided that I was giving up on superheroes for good a few years back – By only reading my work-for-hire superhero comics from 20 years ago, I feel Pádraig has missed out on most of the important stuff of my career. I hope he’ll try “The Invisibles”, “The Filth”, “All-Star Superman”, “We3″ and “Seaguy” at least. – but his work on Animal Man and Doom Patrol is still some of the best work ever done in mainstream comics, and I think that people give him a hard time which he definitely doesn’t deserve. I probably fall into that category myself, although I think I may go rethink some of those ideas now. After all, it’s never too late to change your mind. There is one final thing I want to clear up, seeing as it came up here: Whatever happened to that Kid Marvelman story that Grant Morrison sold to Dez Skinn? Dez Skinn, in Talking With Gods said about Morrison, He was such a quiet unassuming kind of guy when he’d come into the office, he was more like a fan than a professional, you know, very shy, very timid-seeming, but his work was the absolute opposite, it was totally out there, even his early stuff. I thought it was a really nice little five-pager but Alan, like any creator, I guess, who owns material, didn’t want anybody else touching his material. And here’s Dez again, this time talking in George Khoury’s Kimota! – The Marvelman Companion, Grant did submit a Kid Marvelman story, about a discussion between Kid Marvelman and a Catholic priest, and it was quite fascinating because Kid Marvelman argued a very good case against organised religion. Nobody was flying, no beams from anyone’s eyes, but a bloody clever script, clever enough that I sent it to Alan Moore for his opinion. Alan’s reply was, ‘Nobody else writes Marvelman.’ And I said to Grant, ‘I’m sorry, he’s jealously hanging on to this one.’ There is a long-standing rumour that the story was published in Fusion , a Scottish comics fanzine, but the piece in question, called ‘The Devil and Johnny Bates,’ was actually an article about Kid Marvelman by someone else. None the less, Morrison did draw two covers for Fusion including the one for , both of which are reproduced here. Yes, that is Kid Marvelman on the cover of , and Marvelman himself on the cover of . But that Kid Marvelman story never did get to see print, it seems. Which is a shame. I probably have the only surviving copy of the script. One day I’ll look it out and put it online. I seem to remember it being quite good but I made the teenage mod Johnny Bates look exactly like me, forever damning myself as Moore’s Devil! [Top photo courtesy of Jonathan Mayo] .] .” That’s a really good point. “I seem to remember it being quite good but I made the teenage mod Johnny Bates look exactly like me, forever damning myself as Moore’s Devil!” That was a great epilogue. I love both writers work. “That’s a really good point.” Only if you assume that mainstream comics actually deserve more than contempt and denunciation (which, as a whole, they don’t) or that anyone asks/has any reason to ask Moore about indie comics (which, as far as i recall they usually don’t/don’t have any real reason to). Wow. Just… Wow. I think Grant comes off really well here. Love the work of both men. Our Tupac and Biggie. And we don’t have to choose. I think THE INVISIBLES taught us there is no bad guy. “Only if you assume that mainstream comics actually deserve more than contempt and denunciation (which, as a whole, they don’t) ” So am I correct in assuming that you hold mainstream comic books to be deserving of contempt and denunciation? Nothing wrong with thinking that, of course, but I am genuinely curious as to why you think that. I said it in the comment section of Part Three of the original article and I will say it again here….I would love to buy Grant Morrison for what he is worth and sell him for WHAT HE THINKS HE’S WORTH….the ego on this guy is enormous and growing by leaps and bounds by the second….his ego is like the Hulk…the more someone questions it the angrier (or at very least, larger) it gets. GRANT’S EGO SMASH!!!! Read through the above article again and make a checklist….it’s clear that Grant is Grant’s biggest fan, taking time to mention how great Grant is at every turn even though he’s supposedly bestowing the real truth hidden by Moore’s lies. First RED paragraph……I’ve sometimes felt myself to be the victim of a genuine grudge….wow…must be tough to play the victim here Grant, especially when you previously wrote you took pride in being the punk who started crap with other creators when he was younger just to make a bigger name for himself in comics – as he described it, the enfant terrible (his words, not mine). So it’s clear we are dealing with someone who takes pride in being the “trigger” behind the gun (read: problem). Now he has the nerve to call himself a victim? A few sentences later he goes on to thank The BEAT for allowing him to “get some things off his MEDAL HEAVY chest”. Well, I’d like to pin the BIGGEST EGO PRIZE right next to all those medals, but it appears one more prize on his puffed out chest will make Mr. Happy Scribe topple over. The next few paragraphs are laden with “I”. I did this, I did that, I wrote this. I published that. I didn’t read his name (Moore) in a byline until 1982, by which time I’d been a professional writer for almost five years. I survived re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere. I cured Polio. I made love to Mother Theresa and persuaded her into becoming the force of universal peace we have all come to know and love. I, I, I, I, I….yeah…..we get it Grant. You, yourself and “I” and are clearly the greatest thing birthed on this planet. We will never forget this because you refuse to let us forget it. Moving on…after calling Alan Moore a liar ( or at least pointing out his perception of mis-information) he finishes by sugar coating his own stroke-able ego once again…..Morrison says…. Again, why the fibs, other than to reinforce once more the fantasy of me in a junior or subordinate position to himself. The Fantasy of Me as a Subordinate? How dare he? Me? Anyone dare think me a Subordinate? In Grant Morrison’s world the end game for Alan Moore is to lie so that Grant Morrison is perceived his less-than-equal. What this really tells me is, in Grant Morrison’s world he views no one his equal and will call out Alan Moore at every and all occasions to make sure we know it to. Then he takes Moore to task for bashing comics and not using his influence as arguably the biggest name ever in the medium to promote comics at any chance ( I don’t disagree with Morrison here, I think Alan should spend more time helping the industry that helped him make his bones than tossing it aside as an inconvenient step child he no longer wants to care for). But as usual, Grant finishes with a comment about his own perceived greatness because….as you well know….he hadn’t talked about how great Grant Morrison was in over a paragraph and needed to reach his every-five-minute-self-promotion quota before he got behind. He finishes with …..Is he (Moore) genuinely saying that his influence has been entirely malignant? If he actually believed that, I’d almost feel sorry for him. I see my own influence all over the place and I’m quite chuffed. Yep….I see where I have dumped my greatness on others and it makes me smile. I, Grant Morrison have shown you the love and the way…now…kiss my ring finger and be sure to leave a few bucks in the collection plate when it gets passed around. There’s more, but I would imagine you get the point. Perhaps the biggest ego point of all is the fact that Grant Morrison felt the need to come to the Beat, write his own story based on another man’s series of articles so that he can have HIS story straight. I mean, when you’re Grant Morrison, the greatest living creature in the history of existence you need to make sure all the past, present and future history books align and get it right when telling your tale. I’m sure there has been negative stuff, perhaps even downright lies written about Frank Miller, Brian Bendis, Ed Brubaker, Jason Aaron, Kurt Busiek and every other writer out there who has a following or at least a credible creative street cred. These men have all probably had someone (of note or some lowly fanboy who knows not of what he speaks) talk shit about them. mean really….Grant’s ego is so huge (and thereby so fragile) that he has to make sure he gets in an article of his own to verify and or contradict another man’s article? An article that – at its heart- was supposed to be about Alan Moore and his possible strip mining of SUPERFOLKS to create some of Alan Moore’s finest tales….yet Grant has taken the time to turn it into a piece about….well….GRANT MORRISON. Amazing how that worked out, isn’t it? I wish all internet arguments happened like this. [USER] Wayne – Wow, dude. Take a deep breath. It’s going to be ok. blacaucasian, It’s all this left over turkey…get me riled up every time…lol. Seriously….I may be over the top on this…but am I wrong? Think it over and give me your honest opinion…I would really like to know if I’m the only one who sees it this way…. Thanks. >> doubt Grant does, either — I’ve probably corrected more misstatements about myself online than he has, and I certainly don’t go looking for them. I think your characterization of Grant’s statements is, ehh, colorful, to say the least, but not a terribly accurate picture. I doubt he’ll be by to correct you, though. I wouldn’t have said anything myself, but you asked me a question, and it didn’t seem right to answer it and leave the impression that I thought the rest of what you said was an accurate description. kdb Fair enough KDB. Thanks for taking the time to chime in. TW I think we’re going to need to do the old “invite them both to an event without telling them the other is going” and force the two of them to work out their differences and reconcile in front of every one, as the fans need closure! “You were threatened by me? But I was just jealous of you!”. Hug. Tongue kiss. Applause. End scene. [USER] Wayne – Moore and Mozza are two of the best, if not the best two, writers in English language comics. How can you like one but hate the other, I’ll never understand. Also, I advise you not just read the red text, read the black as well – the paragraphs where Morrison gets defensive, aggressive or a little egotistic are usually preceded by a pretty harsh quote about him. He is responding to pretty direct accusations of plagiarism. Also remember, for Morrison this actually is personal. (And y’know, if you read the article, The Beat went to him asking for his response to the third part of their article about Superfolks, which was specifically about Moore and Morrison’s grudge, so probably pull back on the comments about his out of control ego – all you are doing is showing people the sort of fanboy rage criticism based on not reading any facts that Morrison himself refers to at the start). Feuds between successes based on nothing are silly to begin with, and it’s easy to laugh at the self-aggrandising statements Mozza and Moore often make in interviews – although if anyone has the right… – but I truly don’t understand harsh scorn being directed at either one. Laura, Thanks for sharing this article and creating the space for Grant to share his thoughts. Regardless of who we see as right and who is wrong , it’s really valuable to be able to get a “behind the curtain” view from these highly influential creators. It’s fascinating to peel back the layers and see what their influences were and how they perceive the effects of those influences and fellow creators on their work. I can’t help but wish for a little scholarly cold water on the whole “plagiarism” issue. Mapping out influence is a complex business. But using similar plot points as a “gotcha” game, as if this would dismiss a writer even were it true, is not only silly but rather anti-literary. As always, it’s how an artist pulls something off, its tone and effects, not the similarity of Wikipedia plot summaries. Moore and Morrison are distinct and unmistakable for one another. I admire the work of both. The great irony is that, thanks to both their work, what they’ve written will be analyzed and seriously discussed far into the future — and will endure and be loved, long after the personality conflicts involved (or the online fights between fans of “Team Morrison” or “Team Moore”) are the stuff of academic theses. If we love comics, let’s start from there. Ben, Fanboy rage criticism? A bit much…I think…but I’m willing to accept that since I was willing to give such a strong opinon on Morrison. I read the entire article…and my thoughts remain the same…does Grant Morrison not come off as a huge ego maniac? Perhaps my wording is to strong but is it not accurate? And even if The BEAT came to him looking for answers, what was written by him didn’t have to come off as ” I, GRANT MORRISON, WILL SET THINGS STRAIGHT FOR THOSE LESS INFORMED WITH ALL MY WORLDLY KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE, WELL, I AM GRANT MORRISON. Again, I am not some thin skinned punk who is willing to throw rocks from afar and then run in the opposite direction. If I am the only one who feels this way I am more than willing to admit that I may be reading more into it than I should and take all the verbal punishment I am sure will be thrown my way if, indeed, everyone agrees that I am way off base here. I just ask that you look it all over again (including the original three part series) and be sure I am entirely wrong before you call me on this – the man chose specific words to use – and those words draw a picture of how he views himself and how he thinks you should view him as well…at least I believe they do. Thomas, Does Morrison have a big ego? Sure, but so does Moore. Both make grand statements about their own genius on a regular basis – they undercut them with humour, but they do make them. (Although I’ve heard of both seem much more self-depreciating in person when they talk than when it appears in transcript). Both also talk down the others achievements as we have seen – Moore seems to have a general dislike of Morrison, whereas Morrison has specific points of grievance (or annoyance). The “feud” should be beneath them, but I think both having a big ego is fine – hopefully it continues to compel them to keep out doing themselves, and they are the super-star critical darling highly influential comics writers, so the ego isn’t undeserved. Sure, I roll my eyes a bit at Morrison’s suggested structure of Supergods, but I’ve done the same with things Moore has said to defend criticisms of his work (Neonomicon anyone?). You’ve got to give them some leeway when it comes to discussing their art/source of income. End of the day, I’ll read pretty much anything either of them release. They entertain the heck out of me, so I’d forgive a lot more from either writer. I love superhero comics, especially when two gaudily dressed, titanic titans lock horns and beat the shit out of each other in front of everyone on a regular basis. Tune in next month True Believers when marvelous Moore and God like Grant fight it out in ‘ the school playground of all our yesterdays ‘. Excelsior ! Thomas Wayne – I think you are very much reading these articles, and this one in particular, through the lens of your preconceived idea of who Grant Morrison, the distanced personality (I assume you haven’t met?), is. I spoke to him about Pádraig’s series of articles and it seemed like a good time to set the record straight – particularly as it was being picked up elsewhere, and some of the facts didn’t stack up. I should say again, that this was with Pádraig’s blessing. Much of the above is purely factual, but I’m a little amazed that “medal heavy chest”, to name one example, wasn’t seen as the humorous aside that it was intended as. Morrison is a writer after all, an entertainer. It would be a bit rubbish if aside from setting the record straight, it read like a dry old history text book. So in short, yeah I think you are getting the wrong impression here, and I’m not entirely sure where it’s coming from. One thing I’ve found time and time again in the comics industry is that – with notable exceptions – everyone is actually really friendly, praiseworthy of others that they work with and whose works they enjoy, compassionate, and genuine. Whatever else he may be, Grant is just a guy from Glasgow who spends a ridiculous number of hours writing because he loves it, who has time for anyone who wants to chat. Forrest – cheers! I can’t really take credit for this one, and Pádraig definitely deserves thanks for giving his blessing as well. It’s great that Grant has been able to put his story across in the same place the conversation was currently happening. “So in short, yeah I think you are getting the wrong impression here, and I’m not entirely sure where it’s coming from.” Oh, c’mon, everyone who’s ever read any article about Morrison at Beat knows Thomas Wayne’s MO – he hold for objective undeniable truth that Morrison destroyed Batman and Damian is da worst character in da history of da humankind and everything he’s ever wrote is da shite and popular opinion that Morrison is one of the best in comics is product of deluded simpleton minds. So no matter what amount of common sense you try to inject, his endless monologue that Morrison is the antichrist of industry will continue without break. Thomas Wayne, hiding behind a loser nom de plume, listen up. Grant Morrison owns your sad little ass. Owns it. Now go away before more people laugh at you online like they do in real life. There’s a difference between disagreeing with HOW Morrison is defending himself versus disagreeing with his defense. Sure, it might sound egotistical for him to say “I did this, I did that, all years before Moore”, etc., but is he factually incorrect? He does say some things will just be an endless he said, he said debate, but publication dates and convention appearances should be fairly easily confirmed. It just sounds like some people are attacking his post here not for what he said, but how he said it. Which I’d say could be a fair point to judge someone on, but I don’t think the other side of the argument should go without the same judgement, and there still needs to be acknowledgement of what is or isn’t fact. Thomas, Yeah, I think you may be reading a little too much into Grant’s comments, as well. First, it is not de facto egomania when someone defends their position or themselves in a public forum; in fact, what is now held by many to be self-aggrandizement was at one time expected. Second, I think we need to remember the self-deprecating sardonicism of our cousins on The Isle, especially when comparing written speech to oral speech; as was pointed out once in a transcript of an Alan Moore television interview, words which come across as gross hubris in print are wonderfully self-effacing when heard as spoken by the subject (of course, Grant’s rebuttal was intended as written speech, but I hope my point still stands). Finally, I don’t think anyone here can honestly dispute both party’s egos at work, but as I’ve always said, it ain’t braggin’ if it’s true. Fascinating stuff, if rather depressing. I wonder if some clever therapist will come up with a programme to combat the growing incidence of: ‘Comic book creator depressed by the conflict between Moore and Morrison syndrome’ (American Psychiatric Association, DSM-IV). Further reflection…. Why does this shit happen all the time? Because people like Padraig allow Moore to just spew anything and state it as fact. Hell the NY Times even did it with Alan. Sad excuse for journalism. Lighten up, Francis. You might find this interesting Superhero comics generally don’t deserve “contempt and denunciation,” but writers who produce stories that don’t say anything meaningful do. Writing an “illusion of change” story nullifies the possibility of a meaningful theme, since there’s no conflict that produces change. Unchanging villain, unchanging hero, both acting exactly as one would expect–the story doesn’t need to be written. A three-sentence summary would suffice. Superman and Wonder Woman, for example, are icons and symbols, but what’s the point of writing a story about either one that treats him or her as a symbol from start to finish? A story that turns someone into a symbol through recognition of heroic actions is vastly different from one that merely celebrates one’s status. Once a fictional character becomes a symbol, his story is (arguably) done. If a writer handling a superhero produces nothing but themeless stories, there’s no need to read them. The ones that develop the hero should be read instead. SRS Well, as a huge fan of Alan Moore and a huge fan of Grant Morrison (although I found the need to have a MorrisonCon in Vegas a little too rich for my tatstes) I think Grant has made a well reasoned well thought out argument. The problem is that Alan doesn’t frequent the ‘net(as far as I know) and everything he says or does is filtered through the eyes and minds of others. Mr. Wayne ( I’ve never understood the need to hide behind pseudonyms if you really believe in what you say you should also be unafraid of admitting being wrong when you have to) really has somekindoflove/hate relationship with Morrison and should seeagood psycho-therapist to work through his issues, his attacks seem to be sooo personal. So, what side do I chose: Team Alan or Team Grant? Just enjoy their work and be glad as a reader you’ve got both. Since this most recent eruption of the on-again, off-again “feud” between Morrison and Moore, we’ve seen some in the comics community pile on (Julian Darius termed it “Team Moore” and “Team Morrison” which sounds about right), and we’ve seen others in the community understandably wringing their hands over the fighting between two of the most admired and successful writers in the history of the medium. Not me. Don’t get me wrong. I hate fighting, and to the extent that this feud involves real people with real feelings, egos, and reputations, it’s a sad thing because it means two talented, passionate, sensitive, and (from what I can gather) two genuinely good people are experiencing pain. That’s bad in a John-Donne-Ask-Not-For-Whom-The-Bell-Tolls kind of way. However, for those of us sitting in the cheap seats, this ongoing tension has been a positive thing–not because it keeps the gossip mill grinding, but rather because it fuels so much of the artists’ work. Creative rivalries have resulted in some of the most magnificent work in history. What would Shakespeare have been without the intimidating presence of the better educated “college boys” like Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd, or the younger Ben Jonson nipping at his heels? Can you imagine modern art without Picasso and Matisse keeping tabs on one another? How much of Faulkner and Hemingway’s success came from one trying to supplant the other? And look at what happened to Marlon Brando’s career after James Dean’s death and Montgomery Clift’s car wreck. Imagine the Beatles without the Stones or the Who, or even Pearl Jam without Nirvana. How about George Carlin without Richard Pryor. Not nearly as much laughter and not nearly as much truth. Much of our greatest creative work has sprung from the disreputable wells of envy, jealousy, pride, ego, resentment, and anger. When you read through Morrison and Moore’s work (Neil Gaiman’s too), you see an ongoing “conversation” between them pasted all over it. It’s the fuel that gives us Flex Mentallo and the pride that gives us Promethea. As long as no one is drawing too much blood and both of them are able to stay healthy, to remain sane, and to keep on writing, I say let ’em fight. Laura, As I suspected it appears I have gone over the top and Grant’s ego is not as out of control as I have preceived it. Like I said, I am no thin skinned punk who throws stones at a distance. I shall take my lumps ( I mean, when someone as all-powerful as Don Murphy gives me a tongue lashing I should probably rethink my entire life strategy…perhaps join the Convent as I had wanted to as a little girl) and be a man about my choice of words- so apologies to all, especially Grant, for judging a man based on his words, or my perception of them. Keep up the good work. Morrison’s a great writer, no doubt about it. I have many of his books on my shelves and will continue to buy his works. However, it’s sad that the ultimate bad boy rebel is now a company man for DC. I don’t mind the ego if you have the goods to back it, and Morrison does, but he’s really nothing more than a public face for DC. For all Morrison’s complaints that Moore is unnecessarily harsh on modern mainstream comics and how they keep reusing his old ideas, DC sold Before Watchmen this year. There is no need to have “teams” in this…if Alan Moore ever travelled eventually there would be an Old Timers Game where both would come out and shake hands. Unlike Laura, I’ve had nothing but great interactions with both of these savants, and will continue to enjoy their work as long as I’m able to read. I’m really glad to have given Grant a chance to air his side of things. This is fun. How about the Morrison-Mark Millar feud, next time? John Shableski – it’s like Twilight all over again! Greg Carpenter – that’s a unique perspective on things, and you may well be right. Rivalry between artists and writers has been of great historical value after all. Though I do find it sad that the volume of work from Moore has surely been massively curtailed due to various falling outs with others in the industry. Could we have had several other Watchmen-calibre works from him by now if that hadn’t happened? Alas, we shall never know. Cheers Thomas, much appreciated. Chris – Morrison is a freelancer who has worked with DC many times over the years, but he is not a DC spokesperson any more than Scott Snyder, Gail Simone, or Andy Diggle etc. I’ve spoken elsewhere that I don’t believe freelance creators should be punished for their choice of employer, and the decisions that a company makes reside solely with the decision makers within the company. Beatster – but teams are fun! We could sell t-shirts ;) I should mention as well that Morrison has never been against the idea of reconciliation in the past. Suffice to say, it sadly did not happen. On the other hand I do hope no meeting is scheduled for the 21st of December… that’s one prophecy I’d rather not see fulfilled! Laura, A freelancer can be a company advocate. Morrison has gone on record often discussing his feelings in the Siegel/Shuster battles with DC and he’s sided with DC. In fact, I believe his intention of working on Action Comics was to change Superman just enough to protect the IP for DC. His dismissal of Moore’s claims against the company are hard to agree with when DC is currently publishing Before Watchmen. I understand. Morrison, like anyone with a good head on their shoulders, is looking at his future and thinking of his financial security. If he’s decided his financial security is best served by not only absolving his employer of their past sins but by helping them whitewash those sins away, well, he’s his own man and I can’t fault him for making the best decisions he can. I can find fault with the decisions themselves and his justification of those decisions, especially when I’m judging based on the man’s own words. As far as the “freelancer” term, maybe I’m being a little too absolutist, but it seems to me if an independent contractor, which a freelancer is, contracts a vast majority of their work for one company, it’s a bit misrepresentative to claim some sort of independence from that company, especially when the contractor is helping the contractor executing the decisions the company is taking criticism for. Synsidar, Thanks for elaborating. In general, I tend to agree with you, although I don’t so much use the term “theme” as that of “well-told.” Let’s face it: some absolutely dreadful superhero comics have been produced that attempted to pierce the veil, and some jaw-droppingly delightful comics have been produced where a Black Adam does nothing more than try to kick the shit out of everybody (again) for 22 pages. I think that’s the primary beauty of mainstream superhero books – you essentially tell the same tale over and over, many times reducing a character to naught more than its essence, but, when done well, you produce magic. Admittedly, it’s a rather difficult position to argue, because somewhere out there, someone honestly and fervently holds Thor Corps to be the apex of comic storytelling Great, great job Laura. Cheers to Pádraig and Heidi, too. Alan Moore kicks Grant Morrison’s and Don Murphy’s ass at the same time in a street fight! Hahahaha! Fun reading actually. How about an article why Grant Morrison and Mark Millar don’t like each other as well? Comicsbeat is easily one of the top comic book news websites! I don’t like this ugliness. Oh jeeeeeesh. In one shot Morrison has single-handedly almost totally squandered all the respect I had for him due to his not being on Twitter much or being one of those sorts of comics professionals (Breevort, Liefeld, etc) who take potshots so often. Morrison makes some decent points here and there, but the whole thing reeks of jealousy. It’s totally obvious that Morrison owes a LOT to Moore’s influence, and throughout his career Morrison’s actual comic stories have included plenty of barbs against Moore and the idea of what Moore represents to the canon. Morrison has clearly had an Oedipus Complex with Moore for decades now, and just when I thought that maybe he’d grown out of that or left it alone, he comes back with all this stuff. I genuinely understand and appreciate his trying to set the record straight, but more often than not here I get a very strong “Methinks he doth protest too much” vibe. Morrison may have been published in ’78, but he was obviously still an “aspiring” writer well after that. If he was really an established writer in his own right, he wouldn’t’ve “had” to write like Alan Moore by DC’s suggestion or whatever. It’s very true that the genius of Morrison goes well beyond Moore’s shadow, but Moore is still obviously SUCH a big part of Morrison’s artistic identity, and the very content of so much of Morrison’s work is basically predicated on reacting to (if not imitating) Moore. I mean, Moore basically gave up superheroes, especially Big Two superheroes, in 1988. But for 25 years now Morrison has been pulling every trick and double-think tactic he can think of to convince us, and himself, that wallowing supinely in Big Two superheroes is something that smart people should do, endlessly. I’m not a total homer for the guy and think he’s basically wrong on some points, but Moore’s creative range far exceeds Morrison’s. That Morrison can pull out evidence about out “I was doing crappy forgetable indie work in ’78, before Moore!” or “I was into stupid magick FOR REALZ a year before Moore REALLY said he was!” is kind of pathetic, since those aspects of Morrison’s work and character just aren’t all that deep. And Zenith was more than just “a little” based on Marvel Man and Captain Britain… [USER] If Morrison vs Moore is comics Tupac vs Biggie I really hope it doesn’t end with some fan taking things way to seriously and shoot both writers. This article by Grant Morrison is a farce: Those of us who were reading comics back in the day, know he hugely ripped off Brendan McCarthy’s work which was, in the 80s, a stylish, subversive alternative to Alan Moore’s ‘grim’ comics style. The work that McCarthy and his writing partner Peter Milligan produced, like the punk-surrealist ‘Strange Days’, was akin to The Velvet Underground in comics: stuff like Zenith was just a blatant steal from their earlier Paradax strip. McCarthy is on record saying that he invented ‘Danny the Street’ (the most memorable character in what was a pretty good Doom Patrol run), and has expressed annoyance that Morrison subsequently claimed it for himself. Eventually McCarthy stopped working in comics after the swansong ‘Rogan Gosh’ (the ‘suicide on the phone’ motif duly ripped off for Flex Mentallo). Probably got fed up with seeing his ideas stolen by Morrison. Both Morrison and Moore can be decent writers, but are a pair of deeply dishonest bullshitters. They deserve each other. [USER] “I’m not a total homer for the guy…” Homer? for those debating the goodness of superhero comics up there…. that’s not the point. moore in many ways is just as deprecating of indie/web/non superhero stuff. and of course his spiel always begins with the words ‘i haven’t read any of this, but….’ so, yeah, comicdom’s most famous ambassador probably could do with a being less of a pranny. [USER] Mur. [USER] cantor – Brendan Mcarthy designed Zenith, so outrage over being robbed wasn’t why he left comics, and his leaving comics was rather temporary as he’s been at it again for a few years now. I’ve made a jokey comment above: “I wonder if some clever therapist will come up with a programme to combat the growing incidence of: ‘Comic book creator depressed by the conflict between Moore and Morrison syndrome’ (American Psychiatric Association, DSM-IV).” But, in all seriousness, as a comic book writer myself who has been deeply influenced by both men I do find it depressing and disturbing. It’s a bit like a kid’s parents constantly fighting and the kid suffering a degree of disorientation as a consequence. I feel like that character on the Simpsons who shouts out: “Won’t somebody think of the children!” Greg Carpenter makes a good point that such rivalry is often productive, leading people on to more achievement. I am not sure how much that is the case here, or if any of the books they two wrote would not have been written if they had been friendly. The key motivation for them to write was not to better the other, I’m sure. Anyway, I’m talking about the disillusioning affect that their bitter squabbling has on other creators who have been influenced by Moore and/or Morrison. I’m not the only one suffering the syndrome, am I? I say ‘creators’ especially here (although readers in general are affected of course) because as a creator we have given a considerable part of our lives to making comic books (rather than the other roads we could have taken), so it’s obviously important to us. We have done so partly under the influence of older creators or characters or stories that fired us up in some way. There is inevitably a bit of a ‘looking up’ to those creators involved in that, partly because of the age and status differences there when you are a younger creator just starting out. So, there’s likely to be a disorientating and disillusioning aspect if we find out that the ‘wise old man’ figure in your personal mythology is, ah, a bit of a cunt. I’m being frivolous again, and not saying either Moore or Morrison is such, but you get my point I hope. We could be a bit crude and boring and just say about this whole trouble: ‘that’s life, people fall out – get over it’. But I’m drawing on the Joseph Campbell ‘wise old man’ bit deliberately here as it does seem to me that something of that nature may be going on, or its fun to put it into that frame anyway. So, the disorientating and disillusioning affect of finding your heroes are not the shining ideal you once thought they were leads, if we keep at the quest and face these trials and tribulation, to a higher personal state. As he man himself writes: “For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father-face, then one’s faith must be centered elsewhere…” (The Hero With a Thousand Faces, p110) So, to summarise and be silly again – we may be transforming via Moore and Morrison into, ah, Moses. Or since I live in Japan, let’s say via Busiek into… Buddha. Hey Laura, This post has been a great read and the commentary has added quite a bit. Like many, I too have enjoyed their works the funny thing to me is the additional ‘colour’ they bring out of the readership. Don Murphy is the most hated man in the movie industry, which is saying something.. His vendetta against Moore (who loathes Murphy’s shitty films in a very public way) is well known, but his support for Morrison (who can’t get a movie going – unlike his other arch-villain Mark Millar) seems misplaced. As the jackanapes who asked Moore the question on that webchat… The unintelligible mumbling bit of the transcript around the word Vertigo has, I think, led Morrison to respond to a claim other than what Moore made at the time. If I recall, Moore’s claim was not that Berger brought Morrison in for Vertigo, but something along the lines of “what became Vertigo,” referring to the late-80s/early 90s “Berger books” that included Animal Man, Swamp Thing, Sandman, Doom Patrol, and Shade: The Changing Man. In this regard Morrison’s comments about the founding of Vertigo some years later are almost, but not entirely, irrelevant to the point Moore was making. I’m glad to see Grant Morrison sticking up for himself here; he’s usually pretty quiet on his view of ‘the feud’, and I was curious as to his full side of the story. And I’m glad to find out where the Supergods title comes from! Nice one, Mr. M. I’m curious as to why Morrison’s own testimony from Talking with God’s isn’t referenced here as it seems a bit at odds with some of the comments he has above. In it he himself says that he “DC started to recruit because Alan’s Swamp Thing had been very successful. They said they’d give me a call and it was one of those moments .. oh god DC calling.” In other words he admits DC was was interested in him because of Moore. Whether it was because they wanted someone like him or someone directed them to him we don’t know. However, Berger says in this meeting Morrison came up with a number ideas including Animal Man which Morrison states he pitched with a “sub-Moore” approach because that’s what I though Karen wanted.” Also interesting is J.H. Williams’ comment that he sensed Grant just “has to poke at him (Moore) .. I just get the feeling. I have no horse in this race but again if you’re going to build a rebuttal in the voice of Morrison the documentary would seem have some interesting perspective. “…Alan Moore had fallen out with DC over the “For Mature Readers” ratings system…” Incidentally, all but one issues of “Dodgem Logic” had the words “FOR ADULTS ONLY” on the cover. I don’t think Morrison is saying that the success of Moore was in no way influential when it comes to what kind of story DC was looking to tell (he says as much above when talking about the style of the initial Animal Man issues), or which nationality of creators was rich for the plunder, but rather that had Moore not had that success, that the other UK creators would not have stopped pitching, and would not have stopped writing. and that interests had already been expressed. Moore too has spoken more than once of Vertigo being an “Alan Moore farm” which I feel is a little disrespectful towards Karen Berger – Vertigo has produced some of the most important works of the last few decades, and while Moore was the bees knees at the time, the variety and quality of styles coming out of that imprint are under no man’s shadow. “Who influenced/ripped off who” is a bit of a dead end track to be honest, an issue explores in detail in the sequart trackback below, and perhaps something we will come back to later. I think it’s important to note that Morrison has told parts of his history in numerous interviews over the years, and indeed in a documentary, but generally these things have to fit to a narrative. To be entertaining and so on. This piece here is a rebuttal in its simplest form – just the facts ma’am! – and untouched by editor hands. (As an aside – yay for no hatemail! I do like it when I avoid that ^_^ And an aside aside, Morrison really doesn’t seem like a jealous fella to me – he praises Moore’s works repeatedly when he could just avoid all mention, and he comes across as a very peaceful and compassionate person. Why would he be jealous? He’s pretty much doing everything any aspiring writer could want to do, and having fun doing it. IMO.) I’m really glad to read Morrison’s take on things. He’s clearly more level headed and fact based than Moore in his assertions. In my opinion Moore has a handful of good works that aren’t as groundbreaking as he and a lot of fans make them out to be. Morrison on the other hand has a long career of books that are as good if not better than what Moore did. Even when Grant doesn’t like what another writer is doing with something, he’s not yelling that the guy is a hack and thoughtless. So he doesn’t like how Animal Man is going? He’s not telling everyone Jeff Lemire is creatively bankrupt and that no one should buy his book. He just says he would (and did) do it differently. No biggie, a simple difference of opinion. Which is why I like Morrison and his books a hell of a lot more than I like Moore and his. For anyone curious to check out Talking With Gods, the Morrison doc, it’s on Youtube here: and also available on Hulu if you’re in the US. Wow Thomas Wayne, you need some help. Try some Medical Marijuana. I’m a big fan of both writers. *Sorry Grant…….. but Moore is absolutely right on the things he said about Geoff Johns. By the way, there was a really great decoding of Final Crisis by Argentinean magazine Comiqueando (a classic magazine in latin America), which said that basically the story was Morrison denouncing Moore for starting the whole “grim-and-gritty superheroes” era (I haven’t read Final Crisis and it’s been a while since I read the magazine article, so I might be oversimplifying things, but I remember that was basically what the article said). According to the article, the evil monitor Mandaark (who in the story used to be the best of the monitors, but had turned evil) was supposed to be an allegory of Moore. Surprinsingly, I haven’t seen this analysis in English-written comics websites (not that I’ve been looking for it, though). Nothing beats 13,546 issue ‘stories’ that can be done well in just 4 comics like a bunch of overpaid old farts sniping at each other. In the ’90s, when Alan Moore was writing Supreme for Liefeld’s company, he had lots of projects ready for his artists. Then Liefeld’s company went bankrupt. Moore, in order to get quick gigs for his artists – some were stuck with bills, mortgages, etc. – relinquished the creator rights of Tom Strong, Promethea, Top Ten, just so the artists could get money upfront faster. This was a man who had been in an epic fight over the rights of Watchmen, and he gave his rights away again, not for his personal gain, but for the sake of his artists. What has Morrison ever done that is so noble and selfless? Like the little bastard says, he owns everything he’s ever written from Captain Clyde onwards. In Supergods, Morrison claims that Gardner Fox was fired because his style was outdated and DC wanted new voices. I had to discover the truth in an Alan Moore interview: Gardner Fox was fired because he helped organized a writers’ union to demand better rights. Expect MOore to teach you comics history in interviews, and Morrison to defend his employers. When McFarlane asked Moore to write Spawn, Moore asked the regular paying rate, even though McFarlane wanted to pay him more than the other people at Image. In the introduction to Milligan’s Enigma, Morrison confesses that he was invited to the celebrated Italian Lucca Festival, and then he pretended to be sick, and got himself free vacations without bothering to attend the festival. What a dishonest little man! Reading Alan Moore’s interviews from the ’80s to now, one gets the impression he’s always the same person, with the same convictions and voice. Reading Morrison from the ’80s to now is like meeting a different person each time: he has no convictions, no moral positions, no beliefs, nothing, he just flows with the current and bends according to situations and whatever suits. So anarchist in the ’90s, and corporate yes man in the ’00s. The feud to me only matters in one topic: who’s the most morally upstanding person. And I don’t have any doubts Moore takes the prize. It’s odd to say Grant owning his own material is a bad thing, when so many of Moore’s issues with his employers arise from creator ownership, not to mention the fact that Grant actually owns very little stuff out right (most of his creator owned stuff is locked in Vertigo creator owned but not controlled limbo). Present day Image comics creators make the choice to forsake an upfront payment in favor of having full creator ownership. Moore chose to go the opposite direction with ABC and sacrifice his rights in favor of getting payment upfront for himself and his artists. You can argue for both choices, but I’m guessing it was partially to get his own upfront payment as well, since he often seems to take work purely for financial reasons (i.e. writing Neonomicon to pay a tax bill). If Moore is such a benevolent and giving collaborator, why has he wound up on the outs with so many people he’s collaborated with over the years, while Grant has generally good relationships with everyone except for a couple of notables (i.e. Moore, Millar)? Glad to see GM defend himself. I lost a bit of respect for Moorcock years ago after reading some of his comments and the Moore/Moorcock tag team is pretty sad. Mixed feelings about this. The resorting to the old Versus narrative should be incredibly boring and sad Laura, Padraig and Grant indulged in it. As it is, they’re reasonable, balanced and good writers making this a good read, and Grant made me chuckle on a few occasions. I’m sure the initial fallout in the 80s was particularly upsetting then and will continue to be so each time this topic rears it’s head. It’ll be ten or twenty years maybe before writers get round to rearing my feuds with comixer contemporaries, so can we writers maybe change the text before then? A few points: Morrison’s insinuations that Moore got “metafiction” from him appear to be highly questionable: 1) Morrison’s Animal Man is extremely similar to the Alan Moore comic strip from 1978 “St. Pancras Panda” Back Street Bugle , August 15 – September 11, 1978 where the Panda exists the comic and meets Alan Moore, who calls himself God. Morrison appears to be aware of it since he mentions it in the interview. 2) Moore did metafiction before Morrison, both in that Panda strip and “In Pictopia” released in 1986. 3) Morrison did not create comic book limbo as he claims. A brief look at Wikipedia states “Limbo refers to a fictional location in books published by DC Comics. Limbo first appeared in Ambush Bug (vol. 1) (August 1985), and was created by Keith Giffen. [edit]History In Ambush Bug (vol. 1) , Jonni DC mentions removing Wonder Tot from DC continuity having “dumped her in Limbo.”[1] Ambush Bug later returns to Limbo in Son of Ambush Bug .” If Supreme was influenced by anything, it would likely be Keith Giffen. (Although its conceivable Morrison was also an influence, there’s no evidence to suggest it.) Patrick Meaney: I bring up Morrison’s owning his original work because he has used it to gloat on the internet, as a reason why he doesn’t care about the creator rights struggles and injustices happening around him. And to establish a contrast with Alan Moore, who, in spite of his struggles in favour of creators rights, is willing to give away his rights in order to help his fellow artists. My question is, when did Morrison ever so something that selfless for an artist? And I don’t have reasons to believe Moore did it for the money. Moore has refused the royalties of his film adaptations, he’s refused millionaire deals with DC over the years. Moore simply has principles, which is something I understand is hard to comprehend in this dog-eat-dog world. And when Moore is writing for the money, you can tell. You’re not going to tell me Promethea and Neonomicon have anything in common, are you, in terms of depth, theme, structure, characterisation, innovation? So I’ll continue to believe his version of the ABC line, until facts prove otherwise. Why doesn’t Moore have good relationships with his collaborators? You’d have to ask them, or Moore. I’d presume it’s a mixture of several things: 1) Moore’s outspoken, confrontational personality, which is the opposite of the one seen in the industry – everyone pretending everything is always chummy all the time, the myth of the Marvel Bullpen, finally blown to bits by Marvel: The Untold Story; 2) Moore’s collaborators eventually having to work for DC and Marvel, which forces them to be defensive of their employees; 3) and Moore probably not being an easy person to work with. I’d liken him to Jim Shooter, an editor reviled for micro-management but who steered one of the best ages of Marvel, with lots of classic runs. Perhaps people like Moore and Shooter just have too high an expectation of their collaborators. I know I never looked at a Morrison comic book and thought, ‘He really brought out the best in his artist!” Morrison is liked by everyone (except, I presume, Chris Ware and Dan Clowes) because he simply avoids conflicts. He’s never said anything controversial, never stood up for rights, Morrison just wants to work and he’ll behave in order to work for a living. Moore never had problems burning bridges. In this age when we’re starting to see more and more writers and artists finally blowing the lid and expressing what they really think about Marvel and DC, it’s time we finally start seeing Moore as a pioneer. Comics can only improve if more and more creators expose the injustices within the companies. Sadly this says it all, “to get some things off my medal-heavy chest”. He doesn’t mention the dry-humping of Before Watchmen. He only points to ‘2’ works of Moore, yet barrages off a litany of his works. I really want to give him a fair go, after not so with ‘part 3′ of the article. And seriously I can’t read mainstream comics which now goes in circles with renumbering, re-titling etc. Indie comics and Indie writers are going to save the industry, because, DC and Marvel are not going to. Its probably why GM took his book ‘Happy’ to Image . Ahem… just like Alan Moore did so many years ago. Just put on ‘V’ mask GM, you know you want to. interestedfan – that is indeed the point, that such “convincing” conjecture, in either direction, is daft and unnecessary. Miguel – “Morrison is liked by everyone (except, I presume, Chris Ware and Dan Clowes) because he simply avoids conflicts.”. Aru Singh – “to get some things off my medal-heavy chest” is a joke, but I guess a good example of how people choose not to see the joke when they could instead take a meaner interpretation. Before Watchmen was originally on the cards to be discussed, but we felt it would be too derailing from Pádraig’s original intentions and perhaps better fits a later discussion. As it is, it’s the three articles here that were being responded to. I’m slightly amused that coverage of this elsewhere labels Pádraig as a scholar and myself as a reporter – guess you can’t be the former if you write about Morrison! ಠ_ಠ Aru – I feel the need to interject. Moore went to Image when it first started, and when it was publishing Youngblood, Wildcats, Spawn etc. – i.e. a lot of crap dressed up in flash and thunder, rather than the “indie” powerhouse it is today. His first work for them was an issue of Spawn Todd McFarlane asked him to do, and McFarlane paid VERY well – there’s no shame in taking a work for the money, and Moore has always tried to write a good story regardless of the situation, but it’s not quite comparable to why Morrison’s getting Happy! published through Image, considering Moore was writing other people’s titles. How else do you explain his work on Wildcats, Supreme (fine work, but based on another artist’s character regardless), Youngblood, and the eternal classic Violator/Badrock? “medal-heavy chest” is a joke in the same way that Ricky’s Gervais’ ironic references to his Emmy awards etc are jokes e.g. its self aggrandisement masquerading as self deprecation. A few things should be pointed out here: the comments by Alan Moore that Morrison is largely concerned with refuting and responding to here were spontaneous thoughts expressed on a live online web chat as a response to a question he didn’t know would be asked (all questions were submitted live by viewers) (He also didn’t arbitrarily slate Morrison, the question was specifically about the nature of Moore’s relationship with him). To take this article as Moore’s viewpoint vs Morrison’s is very lopsided as Morrison has the advantage of writing from the position of having the time to deliberate and rationalize his views. Moore’s comments were off the cuff and lasted a few minutes; Morrison has seemingly spent a long time thinking about and writing this piece. If Alan Moore were to write a similar piece ( and there’s no doubt at all that he never will) then maybe it would be a fair ‘battle’. As always of course, if you actually watch the footage (and it is online somewhere or other; i’ve watched it) you will see that there is a more playful tone in what Alan Moore says than you would think merely from the text. This doesn’t mean he can’t actually have meant the words but there is a double standard being applied here: Morrison rails against his own frivolous words being brought up to beat him with but misses the point that perhaps Moore too has spoken frivolously in his time? Why do his comments have to have been informed by nothing but spite and bad will towards Morrison (and to be totally without any sense of humour or mischief) but Morrison can say his were purely for effect and mischief and therefore should be discounted as being his actual views? Let’s apply an equal criteria to both men here. One more point: for someone claiming to want to address the ‘issue’ with facts Morrison should have trimmed his coments to exclude such second-hand suppositions as knowing Moore reads his work because some nameless creator told him so. Not only is it totally insubstantial as a claim it has the unfortunate cumulative effect of suggesting resentment on Morrison’s part. “I’m slightly amused that coverage of this elsewhere labels Pádraig as a scholar and myself as a reporter – guess you can’t be the former if you write about Morrison! ಠ_ಠ” Laura, maybe it is to do with the tone and content of your respective pieces? Paidrag’s article was about a point of interest in an author’s work (the influences behind certain elements of Alan Moore’s work) and your follow up ‘article’ changes that into more of a ‘he said / she said’ debate ie. tabloid tittle tattle. You haven’t done any scholarly work here, you have simply presented a platform to someone you acknowledge as a friend. So personally, i would say the two tags were suitably given in this instance. I also feel obliged to say that you are disingenuous with certain things you wrote: ” While Moore has previously spoken out about his thoughts on Morrison in various interviews, Morrison has generally kept quiet on the issue.” Now, i’m sure you know that the two names should be reversed in that sentence. Moore has maybe a few quotations to his name regarding Morrison (and I have an exceptionally deep archive of Alan Moore interviews, as I know does Paidrag; you have to search pretty deeply or have Paidrag’s kind of knowledge to find more than a couple of Moore quotes about Morrison), which are usually prompted by being asked about him (as in the example in this article), whereas Morrison has made many ad hominem comments about Moore, something he acknowledges himself in the article: “These days, if I aim a barb at Moore, and I sometimes do, it’s generally as revenge for having my attention drawn to some latest interview or other.” Here we have the same double standard I mentioned in my comment above: ‘barbs’ aimed at Morrison by Moore in ‘revenge’ at having his ‘attention drawn’ to Morrison are not okay, but perfectly acceptable the other way around. In fact, Moore rarely gets asked about Morrison but Morrison often gets asked about Moore and the reason for that is because Moore’s influence and reputation is greater within the field of comics and massively greater in the wider world beyond comics. And, sorry to say, Morrison’s comments here and elsewhere do seem to drip with resentment about that fact: “Conversely, I can guarantee you will search in vain for a single positive comment about me or my work coming from Alan Moore’s direction – in spite of our obvious shared areas of interest.” Steven – I actually don’t think any of the pieces in this series are scholarly, but that’s rather beside the point I was making. Tabloid? Really? Sigh.. What if Alan is just cranky because he has been cosplaying as Tom O’Bedlam all this time and nobody noticed? Mrs. Sneddon: ”. I realize this will be hard for you to understand, Sneddon, but Moore doesn’t have the temperament of a comic book writer. He’s the only comic book writer I know who thinks, speaks and acts like a great novelist. He’s a well of contradictions, like most great novelists, preaching one thing and doing another. He’s frank, outspoken, erudite, principled, and rancorous. I admire him a lot for that. Better that than the spineless comic book writers who continue to project the illusion that everything is hunky-dory in the comics industry, when every year we see one new creator exploding in public about what’s going on in the backstage – Chris Roberson, Greg Rucka, Ed Brubaker, etc. If Moore feels insulted, attacked, or offended, I prefer he shows that in public rather than pretend the world is all sunshine. How do you know Gibbons, Lloyd et all are ‘nice blokes’? Because they gave you an interview? Do you live inside their heads? Do you know their secrets? They’re entertainers, they live off entertaining people, of course they’ll project an image of nice, cool, easy-going lads. They don’t want to wash their dirty laundry in public. Moore doesn’t have a problem doing it, and I admired him for that. .” There’s nothing selfless about Happy! Morrison is realizing where the wind is blowing, he has finally understood that with Vertigo’s restrictive contracts he won’t get the movies and TV shows everyone else is getting. You can tell he’s hurt no one’s turning his comics into movies, he keeps complaining about that in interviews. So he’s going to Image with a mediocre comic book screaming to be turned into a mindless cool action movie. It’s sad to see the writer of The Invisibles deliver a comic book Mark Millar could have authored, but that’s how the mighty fall. I also assume Morrison’s collaborators don’t have complaints and continue to request working with him because he’s always published by DC/Vertigo, which pays well, and because his comics sell well. So it’s an intelligent decision to work with him. If he continues to write at Image, however, it’ll be interesting to see if many artists are willing to join him. We’ll see what loyalty exists when they stop receiving big DC paychecks upfront. Sneddon: .” Alan Moore doesn’t mention Morrison once in the lengthy book of interviews Portrait of an Extraordinary Gentleman. Moore very rarely will speak about Morrison. Morrison, however, has been attacking him since the ’80s, as the Drivel column shows, and in recent years in Supergods and then in a Rolling Stones interview where he accused him of being obsessed with rape. With due respect, Sneddon, you’re not much an investigative journalist. You’re not Naomi Klein, that’s for sure. Miguel, where does Laura Sneddon claim to be an investigative reporter? She mentions GM’s barb’s in the 3rd sentence so I think she knows about no beard poking at all beard. As for your earlier comment about the Marvel Bullpen, the myth of that has been public record for decades before Howe’s book. [USER] Couple of points: when did Ed Brubaker “explode in public about what’s going on backstage” in corporate comics? I’ve missed that one, all I’ve seen from him is a calm and reasonable statement about the increased frequency of Marvel’s release schedule as the main reason for leaving Winter Soldier, in addition to his creator-owned and movie/tv work. Was there anything more sinister than that? Examples please if there was. Also upbraiding someone for saying a person is a nice bloke and asking if they live in their head, know their secrets, thoughts etc and then going on to ascribing thoughts and motivations for why creators are collaborating with Morrison at Image is quite the leap in logic as you’re doing the exact some thing you berated a person for a few paragraphs prior. Fair to say Laura is more qualified to say if Lloyd or Gibbons are a nice bloke because she has actually interacted with them and can come to the conclusion while you have no idea about the motivations and monetary rewards for why a Darick Robertson, for example, would collaborate with Morrison at Image besides your own wild hunches (a hunch of my own: he wants to work with him. As has many an acclaimed artist and continue to do so; cf. Frank Quitely, JH Williams, Frazer Irving and so on). Sadly the list of acclaimed artists Moore can work with is ever dwindling, whether it be by their own corporate associations or being blacklisted by the bearded one himself. [USER], [USER] Sneddon, [USER]: Given the success of this series, particularly this latest offering, any chance of some textual analysis of the Moore/Morrison feud? That would be a lot more fun than simple he said/he said transcribing, use actual published examples and what they have to say! Off the top of my head, for Moore the Jimmy Olsen analogue was a very pointed critique in Supreme, bordering on unfairly. For Morrison it seems more satirical and gentle ribbing, such as the Beard Hunter in Doom Patrol and All-Beard/No-Beard in Seven Soldiers: Manhattan Guardian, and a more general critique of Moore’s influence on superhero comics as a medium via Mandrakk in Final Crisis. ” Off the top of my head, for Moore the Jimmy Olsen analogue was a very pointed critique in Supreme, bordering on unfairly. ” What makes you think the Jimmy Olsen analogue is commenting on Morrison? I think you are COMPLETELY misreading it. He’s clearly an Alan Moore self parody. He kills the super dog and has Omniman rip his own heart out: similar to things that happened in “What Ever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow”: Bizarro rips his heart (actually I’m not sure about that, can’t remember if he dies from ripping his heart out or kryptonite poisoning) out and Krypto dies. He also writes “The Rape ordeal of Omni-Dog” which can be seen as a parody of Moore’s rape ordeal stuff with Kid Marvelman. Later, in Tomorrow Stories, Moore directly parodies Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow again in First American, where First American writes the fan fiction where “all the comedy villains turn into serial killers.” He also has an intro that says (going from memory) “This is an imaginary story, that may happen, but then again won’t” there’s no ambiguity about it being self parody. Although to be fair, the Supreme annotations online state “Page 2: Moore has clearly positioned Billy Friday as a satire of the “avant garde” British comics authors of the eighties including Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, and Moore himself who introduced a climate of revisionism to comics. Moore has said in recent interviews that he now believes this revisionism stripped superhero comics of everything that once made them charming and clever; this series may be seen as his attempt at atonement.” I’m not seeing any actual references to Morrison, though, despite what the annotations claim. Also Mandrakk (The lame Darth Vader ripoff) being Alan Moore sounds like really stupid fan gossip nonsense. Sometimes a lame Darth Vader knockoff is just a lame Darth Vader knockoff. [USER] Grant isn’t leaving Vertigo, Image is publishing Happy because he wants to be part of Image Revolution and he knows from previous discussions that Karen Berger is uncomfortable with stories that put children in sexual peril. In fact there are projects Morrison is developing with Vertigo.. interestedfan, what are the similarities between Vader and Mandrakk? “interestedfan, what are the similarities between Vader and Mandrakk?” Been a while since I read Final Crisis, but in the last issue, don’t they reveal he’s the boy’s father (“Luke, I am your father!”) Isn’t he some good guy turned bad? His whole schtick is that he’s the primal villain in the primal first story, the basis of all stories, and Star Wars is supposed to be doing the whole Joseph Campbell basic hero of a thousand faces myth thing, kid verse evil dad. And like Star Wars, (and unlike any myth I can name) they save the reveal until later, rather than saying the bad guy is the boy’s dad upfront. It’s pretty bizarre to claim Mandrake is Moore, it’s like saying he’s the creator of the DC Universe and came up with everything at DC comics, it would place him at the center of every idea at DC. If you accept that Mandrake is Moore, you have to reject the notion that Morrison’s stuff isn’t derivative of Moore, it would be an acknowledgment that every DC comic descends from More and is derivative of Alan More. Miguel – so comic writers are spineless and novel writers are above reproach? Hmm. Also, I am neither “Mrs”, nor “Sneddon” – my name is Laura Sneddon or Laura, ta very much. No need for rudeness in this rather lovely part of the internet!. Let’s not pretend you are giving me any due respect though, I think it’s rather obvious you are not. From CBR: RE: Rollingstone Interview!” Whether its true or not, for someone who supposedly isn’t throwing out barbs, this is very loaded to say the least. Rest abridged interview here: -Aru Singh Pessoa: .” I often read Morrison praise the works of other DC employees. Beyond the Big Two, Morrison has no interest in comics. He’s publicly attacked or dismissed the work of Dan Clowes, Chris Ware, the Hernandez brothers, The Comics Journal and Fantagraphics. If an interviewer gets Moore to talk about comics history, though, he’ll only have praise to people like Winsor McCay, Will Eisner, Jack Kirby, Robert Crumb, etc, an eclectic range of comics. Thanks to him I discovered an excellent 1960s comic called Herbie Popnecker. Morrison never made me discover any classics. It’s true Moore doesn’t praise modern comics, but if he doesn’t believe they’re good, why should he praise them? His standards are different than Morrison’s, obviously. As for Moore’s style, it works for him, it has led to masterpieces like V for Vendetta, Marvelman, Watchmen, Swamp Thing, From Hell, Supreme, Tom Strong, Promethea, Top Ten. Each writer should write the way he wants, I don’t even understand why this is an issue or what relevance it has to this discussion. I will however say that I don’t believe Lloyd, Gibbons, Williams III and a few others were ever as good as when they were turning Moore’s dense scripts into pictures. He may he difficult, but obviously something about his writing brings the best in his collaborators. Of Gibbons, for instance, one can’t honestly say that the work he did a few years for Green Lantern is on the level of Watchmen. Sneddon: “so comic writers are spineless and novel writers are above reproach?” Novelists (and writers from outside comics in general), from my experience, are outspoken and confrontational if they think they’re in the right. It’s not uncommon for writers to have falling outs. I can point out a few, for instance: Gabriel García Márquez and Mario Vargas Llosa; Derek Walcott and V.S. Naipaul; Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda; José Saramago and António Lobo Antunes. Only in comics do we have an atmosphere of secrecy and complacency where everyone is obliged to be friendly to everyone else, sometimes just for appearance’s sake. I don’t think that’s healthy, because it curtails a critical spirit. Only dictators like to make people think everything is hunky-dory and orderly within their realms. I’ve read enough cases about creators being exploited and blacklisted in comics and being reneged by their own peers out of loyalty to their immoral employees. Most people are afraid of speaking out because they don’t want to burn bridges with DC and Marvel, comics major employers. If Moore has such standards that others can’t reach, perhaps he’s not the one to blame, perhaps we should hope more would be like him. .” It’s only bizarre if you think everyone should be friendly with everyone. Sometimes people are simply worthy of our contempt and spite. We live in a world where the pressure to be like everyone else is immense. Moore has resisted and has carved out his own life for himself, on his terms. He has the life he wants, and I’m sure he can live with the consequences of his decisions. ” Sometimes people are simply worthy of our contempt and spite. “Yes i think you illustrated your point, but probably not in the way you intended. Laura, are you sure Grant is “kept quite quiet” about Alan Moore? Just read the several interviews that Grant gave and realize that he is the one atacking Moore since the early years. And it’s not my opinion, it’s a fact that you can check anytime you want reading his interviews. And even the Talking with Gods documentaries. It’s quite clear your preference for Grant Morrison, but I don’t think it’s a good thing to do when you decide to choose any sides… specially when you are writing and article like this. Please, let’s try to be impartial on this. Cheers. Robson – I think he has kept quite quiet yes, apart from the barbs which I mentioned – and which people keep skipping that I have mentioned ⊙﹏⊙ I do not think Grant is a saint, I’m sure he’d laugh at the thought, but quite quiet is quite fair. And quite subjective of course! George Bush (not that one) – I like you I do. I do not feel contempt nor spite for anyone, even those who have given me real cause over the years. I knew I was a hippy but I’m happy to be a bizarre one too! It should be noted that Morrison loves a good rape plot thread himself, and his statements about Moore are probably just bad faith. Off the top of my head: 1) Seven Soldiers have the rape and pillage bad guys, one of whom says “Rape Good!” in shining night (If I remember correctly) 2) The rapey bane Batman knockoff and the creepy pedophile priest black glove member in Batman 3) Extended rape plotline in The Invisibles with Fanny, as well as mind control rape villains 4) Final Crises has Marvel Marvel physically and emotionally violated, and its implied she goes around raping people while possessed by Dessad. 5) Sexual abuse plotline in Doom Patrol 6) Villain just threatened to rape Talia and turn her into a prostitute in her backstory issue in Batman Inc. If Morrison really cared about how female comic characters are treated, he wouldn’t be cheer leading DC Comics the way he does. If you wish to be thorough, don’t forget he added child molestation to the backstory of Golden Age boy character Kid Eternity, the detective of The Mystery Play is a child rapist, and Mad Hatter in Arkham Asylum is implied to be a child molester too. I’m not squeamish so I don’t care about rape in fiction, how many rapes Moore and Morrison have in their work is just an absurd point; his comment is only relevant in so far as it reveals that he says things without thinking them through, he’d do everyone a favour if he simply refrained from making these bombastic and controversial commentaries he adores to provoke scandal. “he’d do everyone a favour if he simply refrained from making these bombastic and controversial commentaries he adores to provoke scandal.” Great advice Miguel. Why don’t you lead by example. As much as I’d like to think otherwise, I’m sadly too insignificant for my bombastic commentaries to provoke any public scandal. [USER] You don’t care rape in fiction but you compleated the list of interestedfan. The rape plotline in Doom Patrol is one of the best stories about a girl sexually abused. By the way, Crazy Jane is one of the best female characters. I love her solo story in the epilogue of Morrison’s run in Doom Patrol. You insist freelancer Grant is a DC employee, it must be the example of your idol that called his ex-partner Dave Gibbons a DC employee. I didn’t read any interview where he dismisses the works of Clowes, Ware or Hernandez Brothers, but Grant has the right to have a opinion. In fact he praised Tales Designed to Thrizzle published by Fantagraphics and wrote the preface of True Faith written by the newbie Garth Ennis. He said good things about Marvel writers like Ed Brubaker, Jonathan Hickman and Brian Bendis and he likes so much Image that he wanted do take a part of Image Revolution. It looks like the admirers of Moore think all the quality of his works lie on the talent of the writer, but Swamp Thing, Watchmen, V for Vendetta and Promethea wouldn’t have the same success without accomplished artists like Stephen Bissette, Dave Gibbons, David Lloyd and JH Williams. In a recent comicon, Morrison, Vaughan and Hickman praised the hard work of the artists and recognised their importance. Moore doesn’t have the same love Morrison has for comics as a media. Comics have to adapt to survive in a world with new medias and Grant fights for it. Therefore he accepted to write Action Comics and joined Image Revolution. He embraces the new and keeps moving forward, while Moore is a grouch man that lives in the past. [USER] who. Because I have basic reading comprehension skills Ben. Morrison provides direct and provable evidence that Moore is talking smack about him. This is something Padraig should have done if he was doing a journalistic series as he claims to be doing. It is the same thing the NY Times should have done when they let Moore spew atrocious lies about theWatchmen and V for Vendetta movies, so of course I can’t expect better by a fan press reporter. But of course it should still be pointed out as the bullshit it is. [USER] Berger= yeah give me a call pal, let’s discuss the hate. ANYTIME. @ Pessoa: “Moore doesn’t have the same love Morrison has for comics as a media.” I respect both Moore and Morrison as artists, but what is this comment about? Moore always regarded comics as a unique artform, and fought through his work in the 80s for it to be considered equal to other established artforms. (Proof of that can be found by reading most of the interviews conducted with him, and to have a precise quote, you can just watch his video interview for the promotion of Swamp Thing from the 80s, which is uploaded in You Tube ) In addition the entrance fee for his last conference appearance in 2012 was a donation of a graphic novel to the local library, so that they can build a comics section, so it is highly doubtable that he doesn’t love comics as a media, just because he doesn’t adapt to the modern day comics standards. (The recent exploitation of Constantine by DC, certainly doesn’t prove him wrong at all, does it?) [USER] Moore may have fought for comics in the eighties but more than 20 years later he became a grumpy man. He just complain. I didn’t like the way DC treated John Constantine and I will miss the bastard, but comics industry isn’t only DC or Marvel. Currently, we have a vast diversity in comics with Asterios Polyp, 20th Century Boys, The Underwater Welder, The Score, Habibi, Chew, Saga, Blacksad, Journalism etc. However Moore smugly thinks there is no one on his level today. Instead of complaining so much, he should be happy with the quality of several creators working with comics.… Notice how both their names have the letters A,M,O,R in them. What’s that about? Pessoa: “Currently, we have a vast diversity in comics with Asterios Polyp, 20th Century Boys, The Underwater Welder, The Score, Habibi, Chew, Saga, Blacksad, Journalism etc.” I’ve never seen Moore criticize those by name. His diatribes are aimed at a ‘comics industry’ which I think anyone capable of reading between the lines understands means DC and Marvel. “However Moore smugly thinks there is no one on his level today. Instead of complaining so much, he should be happy with the quality of several creators working with comics.” When he made those comments, in reference to DC’s claim that they had chosen its top-flight talent for Before Watchmen, I think he was pretty justified: JMS, Azzarello, Cooke, please… …” You keep saying the times are changing, but I don’t see what that has to do with comics. I don’t know what this ‘new’ is you speak of, but what I see is Morrison revamping decades-old characters like Superman. And that’s a pretty old game in superhero comics. I don’t believe Morrison is part of any solution. If comics are in danger and need saving, that saving is being done by creators who don’t have any emotional attachment for childhood heroes but create their own stories, the way proper writers do. This was great fun to read. I’ve been well aware of the criticisms launched at Mr. Morrison, particularly by Mr. Moorcock, for some time, so it’s a little refreshing to hear the other side of the story. While I love Alan Moore’s work (and Michael Moorcock’s), I’m a Morrison fanboy all the way. He also seems like a really nice guy in real life (never met), just based on other interviews I’ve read or seen. I think Morrison handled this with as much class as someone defending themselves can, really. For the haters, I mean, this is his (Morrison’s) side of the story, so some of it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. But for me, this just adds to my ever growing respect for Morrison as an artist and a human being. Abhay Khosla posts a good response to Morrison here. Scroll down and you’ll see it. “s. k. m. says: Abhay Khosla posts a good response to Morrison here. Scroll down and you’ll see it. A great column! And some things are quite obvious since we can check the FACTS on internet, early interviews and so. ).” And continues… I’m sorry Laura, but you’re not being impartial on this…(as said before) I know you are a huge GM fan, but saying things like: “He’s been quiet while Moore is yelling” is just wrong (from the impartial point of view, just to be clear). Cheers. Robson – nowhere have I claimed to be impartial, in fact my opening paragraphs make clear that I have had very different experiences with both writers which has an impact on my thoughts. What I have said is that one of the Moore fans above was not being impartial either, and indeed, I think that is the main problem all round. It has devolved into “my writer is better than yours!” which is rather absurd. Clearly both writers have contributed a great deal to the medium, which has little to do with how much any one fan may like or dislike them. The tcj has a history of being anti-Morrison, which he is well aware of, and I’m guessing from their patronising tone towards myself that they don’t much like me either. So also impartial, and a little odd coming a clear week later. I would like to thank everyone here at The Beat for the mostly civil discussion – other experiences this week have thrown that into sharp relief. [USER] Fanboys may think the competition is DC vs Marvel, but the game changed. Today comics is competing with videogames, internet, blu-ray etc and many children or teens prefer the new medias. In view of this, comics must adapt to survive. I don’t know what will be the future of comics industry, but I think it will not be as popular as it was. However there are many creators working in comics industry, Grant among them, and they are trying to fortify the media they love. Your antipathy for Morrison is enormous, you ignore he is writing his own stories for Image and Vertigo. Grant has fun writing about heroes. Fun is a high concept Mr. Moore should try some day…lol… Miguel – who started the attacks? You by the looks of it… So much for keeping things civil, eh? Nope. You’ve been calling me by my surname which of course you must know is aggressive, accused me of talking “crap”, and now talk of getting things “in my skull”. I do my best in written discourse to never speak to anyone in a manner I would be unhappy with doing so in person. That also means I see little point in talking to someone who in person I would think rude and snide. I disagree with what you have said, but I disagree with your manner more. Unless the second is rectified – and I can assure you that how you have written your last two comments to me does upset me – I won’t be able to address the former. Just how I roll. Can you be any more of an ass? Miguel, please stop treating Laura like a child. I hope you’re a much more fun and lively person in real life, because you come across as insufferably smug in these comments. Apologies for the double-post, but is Miguel really calling playing videogames the activity of a child? Someone hasn’t played Shadow of the Colossus or Silent Hill 2. No smug doesn’t cover it, Miguel you are rude, hostile and everything wrong with comic fandom. You attacked Laura repeatedly with straw man attacks and rudeness and made so many illogical statements that I hope you were trolling and not really this stupid. Give it a rest a hole. Whoops sorry I took a day off. Miguel you are WAY out of line. It is fine to disagree but the crude, abusive language you are using is unacceptable. Buh bye. didn’t Brendan McCarthy distance himself from Morrison for ripping off Paradax when writing Zenith? I’m pretty sure they are not buddy buddy… and no one gets between me and McCarthy!!!! I like the Filth, I like Animal Man, I like We3 and Invisibles and Flex Mentallo, but Morrison himself, not really. Same with Moore, honestly. I’m not sure I’d like either one in person. Although I end up siding with Moore at the end of the day. Great clear headed thoughts from Julian Darius over at Sequart. “didn’t Brendan McCarthy distance himself from Morrison for ripping off Paradax when writing Zenith?” I think McCarthy designed Zenith. And if he distanced himself, it couldn’t have been over primarily Zenith since Morrison convinced McCarthy to design the Skrull Kill Krew according to Tom Brevoort. An excellent article! I hadn’t read this until Marc-Oliver Frisch linked it in his sales chart column but thank you for exerting all the effort it must’ve taken to put this together. I think Grant Morrison makes many excellent points. I like (and sometimes dislike) both his and Moore’s work but Moore’s increasing negativity seem to border on delusion at times. It’s a pity that Grant will never read this comment, but I’ll try to find some other way of buying him a pint (anywhere in Partick). Pretty strong meat there from Longeur. This is interesting but childish stuff. I love loads of Grant Morrison’s work, loathe some bits and am ambivalent to others. Same with Alan Moore. They’re both innovative and derivative. Moore’s LoEG owes a massive debt to Kim Newman’s Anno Dracula novels particularly the Bloody Red Baron which featured the likes of Mabuse, Caligari, Robur and all manner of pulp characters years before LoEG was published. Likewise, Grant Morrison picking at Moore’s psycho sexual hang ups is a bit rich considering his penchant for transgendered characters. Meta Maid is hardly a sympathetic treatment and the Fanny / Bodie from the Professionals bit in Invisibles is just a grimmer rehash of the TNT Tom / Meta Maid liason at the end of Phase III of Zenith. And I don’t even want to go into Tex Porneau / Spartacus Hughes territory. “And if Moorcock made any complaints to DC in the ’90s, I never heard about them. I had no idea there was any beef with Moorcock until Pop Image’s Jonathan Ellis drew my attention to it in 2004.” – Grant Morrison, quoted above. “He said my work was crass and immature and a disgrace, but, as Mark points out, Michael Moorcock branding your work crass and immature is probably a great compliment! I think he read one issue and has no concept. He’s made a fool of himself because he seems to think that the whole of The Invisibles is based on the Jerry Cornelius concept without having read the rest of what we’ve done.” – Grant Morrison, quoted in SFX (January 1997), pp.39-40. grant BORE-ison and alan BOORE And what about Frank “right minded” Miller, and Neil “”fascist” Gaiman. ROFL Once there was a wizard called Alan. He was the most powerful wizard in the land. And he had two sons, Neil and Grant. He loved Neil more than Grant and gave Neil his secret spell book, so that he might become his heir. But one night, Grant stole his spells for himself, and made himself a powerful wizard in his turn. In time, Grant made his own spells, but Alan always suspected that these spells were in fact spells from his book in disguise. Neil got bored with magic spells and decided to get a proper job instead. The end. This is worth a read again in light of the Jan ’14 Moore interview, I think? -B I’m with ‘Thomas Wayne’, Terry Cantor and Miguel on this one; their comments on Grant Morrison, his career and his antagonistic relationship to Alan Moore have been vigorously expressed in a manner the Grant of old would have heartily approved of, if they were discussing someone else and not Grant himself. The minor differences in age between Moore and Morrison would seem to make them equals in terms of attitude, background and outlook, maybe even politically compatible, but IMHO, Moore seems to be from a completely different generation to Morrison going by the differences in their general tone of their work. Moore’s Captain Britain work with its Jim Jasper’s induced fascist rewiring of British society isn’t so different to the police state V and Evie fight against in V For Vendetta. Moore also produced work for things like Brought To Light and AARGH! in the late 1980s AND refused to work with DC Comics on principal over the ratings controversy, as did Frank Miller, at the same time. Moore also spoke out against Marvel Comics’ treatment of Jack Kirby when Marvel was refusing to acknowledge Kirby’s contribution to creating almost all of the early Marvel Universe characters. I don’t see the same spirit or approach Moore has to his work or public comments in interviews in Morrison’s own output and never have. Or heard or read Grant speaking out against anything at all apart from trivial things such as Neil Gaiman already making a million quid a year by the early 1990s, for example. It’s obvious from Grant’s outpourings that he considers himself a contemporary of, and an also an equal to Alan Moore. I don’t believe he is. Moore’s more personal work reflects a pessimistic outlook on the world in general; V For Vendetta was Moore’s response to the way British society was being affected by Thatcherism. Morrison’s work at the same time as V was serialised in Warrior magazine was the Zoids comic, followed by his absorption by DC Comics in their then UK comics industry sweep for the next Alan Moore. Moore finished off V For Vendetta, his masterpiece, over at DC Comics in the late ’80s as well as Watchmen with Dave Gibbons. Grant was, I believe, starting up on Animal Man. A well regarded strip but no Watchmen. Fandom at this time was also purchasing the new Marvelman/Miracleman stuff from Eclipse Comics, another strip left unfinished with the demise of Warrior magazine. While Morrison is a very prolific, varied and professional writer, the vast majority of his work leaves me cold. I also lost any respect I may have had for him when he shoehorned a Morrissey cameo in Cut magazine’s The New Adventures Of Hitler in 1988. Grant doesn’t mention this strip very often, it seems. I wonder why? Morrison’s an intelligent man but Alan Moore’s intellect is on a another level to Grant’s. In Supergods, Grant admits to using his Doom Patrol and Invisibles stories to actualise his own personal fetishes and desires, presumably being too reticent, withdrawn and afraid to take the plunge in searching out BDSM clubs himself. Moore’s work throughout his career, apart from his Image and ABC stuff, has always had what Morrison abhors – realism, ordinary boring unpleasant grim realism, admittedly seen from the POV of extraordinary characters. Moore’s left superheroes far behind. Grant hasn’t. Why would someone that I recall from an early 00’s Glasgow Herald interview claiming a lack of interest in writing superhero comics because, and I’m quoting from memory here, science is actually on the brink of creating superheroes in laboratories thus making comic books finally redundant? I’m still waiting to see these super humans, Grant – where are they? Moore’ s later work I’m indifferent to. Ditto for Frank Miller. Morrison’s stuff can’t hold a candle to anything Moore and Miller produced in their prime and Grant is resentful of that. Thank you for compiling this thing. There is two sides to every story and then the truth. I think Grant Morrison has put a robust defense here but the chink in the armour is the Moorecock stuff. Are you really saying Grant that you’d let a young writer in the industry essentially mimic or rip parts of you off and just pass it off as a homage and you’d be cool with it? Are you really going to give that the greenlight or be a grumpy old man in a few years like Moore? Seems you have put yourself on a bit of tightrope there. Moore vs Morrison is akin to Stephen Fry attempting to annoy Irving Welsh, a pointless task that has only served to illuminate Moore’s obsession with Morrison while failing woefully to establish anything like the converse, an allegation he doesn’t even manage to make convincingly never mind present evidence for. A lot of people are unwilling to take sides on the dispute because they value both writers but I’m prepared to say that Morrison’s movements in the 90’s were forward whereas Moore’s have been consistently backwards towards the Dickensian era he now inhabits as only a curmudgeon can. Bring on Morrison’s divorce and rebirth upon the world stage as a provocateur because if an old tight beardy is all we’ve got as a legacy (other than the Time Warner mack) then our sentence is definitely not up. *Time Warner mask I love this feud. Especially that it’s been going on for so long. Part of me hopes that these two brilliant minds are working together to create this plot beyond their convention… It wouldn’t be unimaginable, or uncommon for either, that they would hatch a plot that begins with comics and extends into reality. Of course it’s probably a sad argument, one that we have very little business being a part of, fueled by spite, misunderstanding and perhaps some chest beating. I love both of their work and hope that this is play, an expansion of their universes into ours, to influence and play with our lives. The story of them making this story would be far more heart warming than the reality these interviews suggest. Either way, bravo to both and look forward to reading more.\n",

Fall 200S our unpversi Much of this issue of Shafer Court Connections is devoted to commemorating the birth 4-0 years ago of Virginia Commonweahh University. VCU is marking its anniversary with a variety of opportunities for alumni to share in commemo- rative and celebratory activities and programs. I hope you will capitalize on this special time in our history to make a new connection — or strengthen your existing bond — with your university. I urge you to visit the \"Fortieth and Foi^ward\" anniversary Web site at, where you can revisit VCU's history and share your own memories in a virtual time capsule. You also can be a part of this historic celebration by joining VCU and the Richmond community at the Monroe Park Festival, which kicks off at noon Saturday. Oct. 25. in Monroe Park. The festival will feature the best of VCU today and yesterday as well as musical performances from local bands nominated by students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends. Rumor has it that the infamous \"Ask It\" booth and other alumni favorites might re-emerge for this special celebration. As always, your alumni magazine showcases graduates, students, faculty and staff who represent the cherished values that reflect the intellectual excellence of your university. I hope you will pay close attention to an article explaining the increasingly critical role private support from alumni and friends plays in the future of your alma mater, as public funding for higher education continues to decline. I've heard it said that VCU has evolved from a state-supported to a state-assisted university, and now we find ourselves most accurately described as state-located. Our future margin of excellence rests in the hands of our alumni and friends. Anniversaries and birthdays mark significant milestones and accomplishments while providing the opportunity for reflection, celebration and renewed commitment, enthusiasm and energy to achieve our mission, shared vision and goals. This year presents an opportunity to celebrate the milestones and accomplishments of VCU across the past 40 years while looking ahead to the exciting prospects for future collaborations and discoveries. I encourage you to reflect on the role VCU has played — and continues to play — in your life and to take this opportunity to get involved- Your university will be enriched by your participation and leadership. According to your fellow alumni who have joined the VCU Alumni Association as active dues-paying members, the benefits and enrichment go both ways.

Gottfredson, provost and vice president for academic affairs at VCU. \"With their success, these students illustrate the outstanding scholarship and teaching excel- lence at VCU in the fields of math, science and engineering.\" Goldwater Scholars are selected on the basis of academic merit. This year, 321 scholar- ships were awarded to sophomores and juniors from a field of more than 1,000 applicants. The one- and two-year scholarships cover the cost of tuition, fees, books, and room and board up to a maximum of $7,500 per year. (From left) Mary Beth Bird. Allison de Groot, Jeannette Aiken and John Bajacan Singers pay tribute to Olympics The Commonwealth Singers, a select cho- ral ensemble of VCU. appeared in concerts in Beijing and Shanghai during a Mid-Atlantic Choral Tribute to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. May 27 to June 5. John Guthmiller, director of choral activities and chairman of VCU's Department of Music, conducted the group as well as ensembles from four other schools in concerts at the Forbidden City Concert Hall in Beijing and at the Cultural Arts Center in Shanghai. The concerts showcased the work of more than 230 performers, including a Chinese orchestra and Chinese soloists, and drew large audiences, with more than I.OOO attending the Shanghai performance. Dr. Irani signs national green compact In April. VCU President Eugene P. Trani. Ph.D.. signed a national compact among col- lege presidents to address global warming by working to neutralize greenhouse gas emis- sions on campuses. The American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment represents an initiative to reduce the global emission of greenhouse gases by 80 percent by midcentury. Earlier this year. VCU's Student Government Association urged university administrators to seek ways for VCU to embrace sustainability in design and stewardship. \"This type of formal compact highlights VCU's commitment to work with universities across the country to demonstrate leadership in the community by modeling ways to minimize emissions that contribute to global warming.\" Dr. Trani says. In addition to efforts already in place across VCU's campuses to conserve energy and reduce emissions, VCU is constructing several build- ings to LEED standards, the nationally accepted benchmark for optimal energy and environ- mental design and construction. VCU, W&M partner on health policy VCU and the College of William and Mary have formed a signature collaboration to address health policy. The VCU-William and Mary Health Policy and Law Initiative will bring together faculty and students from VCU's L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, the VCU School of Medicine and the William and Mary Law School to conduct research and provide public service. The initiative's first service-learning project, set for January 2OO9. is a Veterans Disability Clinic. Future plans include offering joint degree programs that focus on solving topical problems in health policy, law and bioethics. 6 I VCU Shafer Court Connections Research repor; Barnes & Noble @ VCU flags fly outside the Monroe Park Campus bookstore. Barnes & Noble comes to campus VCU welcomed national bookseller Barnes & Noble to campus this summer — providing new bookstore options filled with a wider range of publications and resources, including access to more used books. Barnes & Noble will integrate its national image with VCU's own distinct identity at both campus bookstores. Renovations to the Barnes & Noble @ VCU on the Monroe Park Campus were completed this summer, while Barnes & Noble @ VCU Medical Center will begin its upgrades this fall. Grad earns Fulbright Scholarship Jessica Langley (M.F.A.'o8/A) has earned a Fulbright Student Scholarship to study and pur- sue her artistic interests in Iceland. Langley will travel to Iceland for the 2008-09 academic year to study the country's landscape and to create art inspiredby her surroundings. Upon her return to the U.S., Langley hopes to increase the exchange between Icelandic and American artists. Langley is the fourth VCU student to receive a Fulbright Scholarship in the past three years. Partnership aids ASD instruction VCU and 15 public school divisions in Central Virginia have formed a partnership that will provide training and professional development for teachers of students with autism spectrum disorders. The Region I Autism Education Consortium will provide educational opportunities to benefit nearly I.OOO children with ASD. The consortium also plans to create a structure for schools to access staff development resources, implement research-based practices and methodologies, and enhance and build parent partnerships. entifies gene with possible schizophrenia VCU researchers have identified a gene associated with schizophrenia that could provide further insight about the pathophysiology of the disease. Led by Xiangning Chen, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and human genetics in VCU's School of Medicine, and Kenneth S. Kendler, M.D., professor of psychiatry and human genetics in VCU's School of Medicine, the research team studied variants of the gene, MEGFlO, in affected and unaffected individuals from Ireland and Northern Ireland. Supported in part by the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, the team found that some variants of MEGFlO had a higher frequency in schizophrenia patients than in healthy controls, and these variants were associated with higher expression of the gene in the brain of affected subjects. This \"provides evidence that a gene directly involved in apoptosis, or cell death, is associated with schizophrenia,\" Chen says. \"Apoptosis has long been speculated to be involved in schizophrenia, but no gene directly involved in this process was found to be associated with the disease.\" Anti-cancer drug combination induces cell death in CML VCU Massey Cancer Center researchers have discovered that a combination of anti- cancer compounds kills chronic myelogenous leukemia cells previously resistant to conventional forms of therapy. Imatinib mesylate inhibits the activity of a mutant protein, known as Bcr/AbI, which is responsible for CML; however, patients eventually become resistant to imatinib mesylate, often through the development of further mutations in the Bcr/AbI protein. According to Steven Grant, M.D., Massey's associate director for translational research, and co-leader of the cancer center's Cancer Cell Biology Program and senior author of the study, resistance to imatinib mesylate prompted the search for newer agents. Working under grants from the National Institutes of Health, the V Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America, and the Department of Defense, Grant and colleagues examined the effects of combining MK-0457, a Bcr/AbI kinase inhibitor, with vorinostat, a drug recently approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. They found that this combination leads to a dramatic induction of programmed cell death in CML cells, including imatinib-resistant cells. Preclinical studies are under way to test whether it may be possible to develop a clinical regimen based on these findings. Trend in waterpipe smoking signals future health problem More U.S. college students are smoking tobacco using waterpipes, or hookahs, and it's becoming a growing public health issue, according to a new study led by Thomas Eissenberg, Ph.D., associate professor in the VCU Department of Psychology. Under grants from the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute on Dru Abuse and the Fogarty International Center, Eissenberg and his research team con- ducted a cross-sectional study of approximately 744 students, mostly between the ages of 18 and 21. Approximately 43 percent of those surveyed had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past year; and 20 percent of them had smoked tobacco using a waterpipe in the past month. In addition, users were more likely to perceive waterpipes as less harmful than cigarettes compared to those who had never used a waterpipe before. According to Eissenberg, current and prospective waterpipe tobacco smokers should be made aware that waterpipe tobacco smoking is not as benign as they might think. Waterpipe smoke and cigarette smoke contain some of the same toxins — disease- causing tar and carbon monoxide, as well as dependence-producing nicotine. mBf^j^ ' w'S^ ''Stt. Fortieth and forward Virginia Commonwealth University celebrates its first 40 years with an eye toward the future The ^Oth anniversary of Virginia Gonunonwealth University revisits a historic moment in higher education, when in ig68 the General Assembly established an urban university in the heart of Richmond. With more than 32,000 students, VGU today represents the state's largest pubhc university and embodies academic and research excellence indelibly tied to the histories of its founding institutions — the Medical GoUege of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute. This year, the university celebrates the important milestones that have helped shape VGU and the vision for tom^orrow's possibilities. ■MibsJ^ m Virginia Commonwealth University's legacy continues in the tradition of two celebrated institution^ •* \"\"-^ '-«:-:*»:* \"■'^i'':- - l\"^^i/4*i^ IHi^ll r /CU Shafer Court Connections «i®gas^i „, _gNi_. ,_. ^ _. «' orty years ago, Virginia General Assembly enacted a bold concept vhen it used the infrastructure of two separate institutions, amedica college and an entrepreneurial pro- fessional institute, to create Virginia Commonwealth University. The founders involved in the university's creation might not recognize the current VCU — one of the top research universities in the country. Their underlying vision of this urban university, however, remains. VCU's story begins in the early 1960s when sup- port increased for Richmond Professional Institute to become a full-fledged university. In 1965 RPI e.-peri- enced the largest enrollment increase in its histoiy. That same year, the Higher Education Study ComiTiission, chaired by state Sen. Lloyd C. Bird, concluded that the Richmond area needed a \"bold, new development,\" in other words, a major university. The Bird Commission recommended combining two existing institutions, RPI and the Medical College of Virginia, to create this uni- versity. The rationale behind the proposed union was that the two schools would be a formidable combination, stronger together than each was on its own. The idea of pooling the resources of MCV and RPI made sense and, to many people, seemed like a natu- ral fit. At the time of the commission's report, the two schools already intersected in many areas. RPI's public health program had been using MCV facilities and fac- ulty since its inception. Plus, a number of cooperative programs existed between the two institutions, includ- ing a joint doctorate in clinical psychology. By the 1960s, MCVstudents were taking English, history, statistics and economics courses at RPI or with RPI instructors who worked as adjunct faculty at the medical school. Following the Bird Commission's report findings, the 1966 General Assembly formed another group to go forward with a plan for the state university. Edward A. Wayne Sr., president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, chaired the commission. Wayne's vision for the school took the Bird Commission's recommendation a step further. He proposed not a merger of RPI and MCV. but instead the creation of a completely new entity with the two schools as its components. The commission's report was unanimous and recom- mended the establishment, effective July I. 1968, of \"an urban-oriented state university in Richinond to embrace and build upon the Medical College of Virginia and the Richmond Professional Institute.\" Members of the commission contended that \"an urban-oriented university is unique in that its basic phi- losophy concentrates on meeting the needs of an urban population living and working in an urban environ- ment. \"The city is truly its living laboratory. \" The commission's recommendation, supported by the governor and the General Assembly, created VCU. After considering other sites for the university, including locations in Henrico, Chesterfield and Hanover coun- ties, the report recommended that the existing location realized the \"\"urban university \" concept. Any initial concerns about the creation of VCU less- ened over the years as the university took shape. Each of the university s four presidents — Warren W, Brandt, Ph.D., T. Edward Temple, Ph.D., Edmund F. AckeD, M.D., D.M.D., and Eugene P. Trani. Ph.D. - built on the work and vision of his predecessor to fulfill the university's mission of teaching, research, public service and patient care. The original concept that emerged from the Bird and Wayne commissions of an urban university using the city as its laboratory continues to resonate today as students on the MCV Campus and Monroe Park Campus engage in these areas under one very expansive roof. Today. VCU stands as the largest public university in the state, tripling its student body to more than 32. GOO, and ranks among the top lOO universities in the country in sponsored research. To commemorate the university's anniversary and acknowledge its tremendous growth in such a short time, a Virginia Senate Joint Resolution introduced by state Sen. Donald McEachin designated July I, 2008, as VCU Day. The resolution recognizes VCU \"as a leader in teaching, research, public service and patient care for the city of Richmond, the common- wealth of Virginia and the United States. \" As VCU looks toward the ne.xt 40 years and beyond, the university takes pride in the rich history and accom- plishments of MCV and RPI. Through the blending of campuses, faculties, staffs and academic programs, VCU embodies the vision of those who believed in a strong single institution shaped by a common mission and shared goals.

Mills E. Godwin Jr.'s 1968 legislation that created Virginia Commonwealth University, the new entity fashioned from the Medical College of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute began to forge its own identity. Forty years ago, VCU's footprint encompassed approximately IIO acres and the student body totaled I0,000. Today, its size exceeds 140 acres and 32,000 students. \"VCU had none of the physical pres- ence nor the stature that it does today, \" says Hugh Keogh (M.S. '81/MC), president of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, \"but it was impeccable at catering to the needs of the full-time professional.\" Like many VCU stu- dents then, Keogh worked during the day and took classes at night. A more mature student body was the norm at that time. \"The movement in Virginia toward everybody get- ting a higher education was on,\" says Ed Peeples Jr., Ph.D., (B.S. 57/E). VCU associate professor emeritus of preventive medicine and community health, \"so people were showing up at the door.\" 12 I VCU Shafer Court Connections The Academic Division of the University — later called the Academic Campus and now known as the Monroe Park Campus encompassed a handful of buildings, many of them historic landmarks, within a few-block radius. \"It was just a small, cobble- stone campus back in those days . ' says Ken Magill, Ed.D., (B.S. '65/B; M.S. 'Gg/E), retired associate professor in the VCU School of Education. The Elealth Sciences Division — now known as the MCV Campus — was equally compact, sitting in a square between Broad and Leigh streets. Many of the instructors were local physicians who taught as adjunct faculty in whatever rooms were available. \"The MCV Campus was very much a town medical school.\" Peeples remembers. Facilities did not immediately improve with the stroke of Godwin's pen. Witnesses to VCU's emer- gence from its two parent institutions, however, recall it as an exciting time. \"In the early days of VCU, it was a kind of a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland kind of school,\" says Lester Van Winkle, professor emeritus in the School of the Arts, who joined VCLf in 1968. \"It was like, \"eah. we've got an old building over here and we've got some students. We'll make some classrooms. ' There was that sort of flavor to the school. \" The vital faculty and engaged students enlivened the place, but space was certainly at a premium in those early days. The Anderson Building, home to the current Anderson Gallery, was the de facto library. Needless to say. the site was inadequate even though the volume of titles and journals was expo- nentially fewer than the number VCU has today. Ul^. \"The Department ot Histor)' had about six or eight cardboard boxes of books on the third floor of that building and that was the com- plete histoi'y holding. \" says William Blake Jr., Ph.D., a professor of history since 1965, at RPI, then at VCU. \"Now, we've got thousands of history books. We went from a few hundred books to literally thousands and thousands of history volumes. \" Peeples remembers teaching in the Anderson Building among the piles, giving new meaning to library \"stacks. \" \"The books were all over the floor, \" he says. \"If somebody tipped them over, they would never find what they were looking for.\" At this time of transition, VCU used the resources available to accommodate students and faculty while working out its growing pains. As Keogh says, VCL^ was still clearly emerging and beginning \"to flex itself a little bit as an attractive option for higher education in Virginia. \" 4 Fall 2008 j 1 sr % THE BRANDT STAMP With the naming of Warren W. Brandt, Ph.D., as VCU's first president, the wheels began moving to mold the university into a place where students could earn a top-notch education in a stimulating and comfortable environment. Brandt also had the very difficult job of uniting the two administrations — each with its different facilities, processes and rules — into one cohesive unit. Combining the two previous insti- tutions was not an easy sell at first, says Blake, who as the first president of the ^^ — * \"^ VCU Faculty Senate helped bridge the ^^^V ^B gap between the two campuses. It was a ^K pH bit of a challenge, he says, \"because the ^Jmy' -^^^tk people at MCV had a long tradition.\" 4MBJPUMP|H|M John Borgard, Ph.D., associate dean of undergraduate academic affairs from 1999 to 2004, first came to VCU in 1971. He says RPI traditions fueled corresponding feelings on the Academic Campus, with some faculty resisting change. \"A lot of people wanted the university to continue to be an RPI atmosphere because it was kind of an 'in' atmosphere and to go big would not be true to the beginnings of this school.\" - John Borgard, Ph.D.. former associate dean of undergraduate acac/emic affairs \"A lot of people wanted the university to continue to be an RPI atmosphere because it was kind of an in atmo- sphere and to go big would not be true to the beginnings of this school.\" Slowly, faculty members became energized by the direction the university and Brandt were headed. He had definite ideas of how to enhance the student experience and pushed for summer orientation programming in which each freshman student talked with an adviser for 30 minutes. \"It was something that Brandt talked about and we said. That's a good idea, \" says Borgard. It was a big part of getting students off to a good start.\" During Brandt's administration, VCU became Virginia's largest university with 17,000 students. The university responded to the demand by adding 32 new degree programs and the schools of Allied Health Professions and Community Service. Just as important, the construction and acquisition of numerous build- ings strengthened the university's infrastructure in order to emphasize Brandt's vision for expansion of research opportunities, programs and schools to come. The structures built or acquired during Brandt's ten- ure included the James Branch Cabell Library (just the first floor; the other three would be built in 1975)' Rhoads Hall and the School of Business building on the Academic Campus, and an addition to the TDmpkins-McCaw Library and expansion to Sanger Hall on the medical campus. Despite the flurry of building, the campus still felt spread out, \"When I arrived, I was really kind of unsure about where VCU was, \" says Greg Wingfield (B.S. '74/H&S M.U.R.R '76/H&S), president and CEO of the Greater Richmond Partnership. \"It wasn't like you walked through the gates and said, 'Here I am.' VCU was here, there and evei-ywhere. \" Students had no real gathering place. The University Student Commons did not exist; it would not be built for another decade. Students soon discovered the Shafer Court corridor and it became the unofficial hangout. \"That was kind of ground zero for student life back then,\" Wingfield says. Marsha Shuler (B.S. '74/B), senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, recalls having her business classes in various old buildings on Franklin Street. Wlien the School of Business building was finished in 1972 \"that made a huge difference as far as students get- ting to know one another and having die capability to study together, \" she says. Brandt's tireless efforts to establish VCU as a university of high academic standing ended with his retirement in 1974 and laid the gi-oundwork for his successor. A BRIEF REIGN Inaugurated in 1975' VCU's second president, T. Edward Temple, Ph.D., died after only 21 months in office. Still, he managed to create a lasting leg- acy. As president, he revamped VCU's administrative structure and developed a \"traveling road show \" to showcase the university to the public. \"He had a magic with people, ' Peeples notes. \"He served the great purpose of legitimizing VCU among state people.\" Temple also campaigned for a new hospital on the medical campus, which improved relations between the two campuses. \"He would take in people s opin- ions and he'd put them to work.\" Peeples says. \"But Ed Temple added a social-psychological dimension that was so necessary and he underscored the urban mis- sion and the service side of things.\" After H.I. Willett served as interim president for one year, Edmund E. Ackell, M.D., D.M.D.. becaine VCU's third leader. A former dentistry professor and the vice pi-esident for health affairs and special assistant for governmental affairs at the University of Southern California, Ackell further united and expanded the two campuses. A BUILDING BOOM Ackell's 12 -year tenure marked the beginning of a period of inajor develop- ment for the university. VCU experienced its larg- est growth spurt up to that time, with a budget that ballooned from $135 niillion to $43^ million. The student population topped 20,000, so one of Ackell's main focuses was additional construction. During this stint, a new hospital, a cancer center (now the Massey Cancer Center), a student commons, a performing- arts center, a pharmacy building, a residence hall, athletic facilities and two parking decks added to the growing campus footprint. With the addition of the first phase of Gladding Residence Center, completed in 1979' VCU moved from strictly a commuter school to a more traditional university where students lived on campus. \"Students now had a chance to engage themselves on the campus in ways that they didn't in the 1970s and before that,\" Borgard remembers. As more students remained on campus, VCU branched into the safety business. \"VCU really was on \"The obvious change is the diversity. Where it was a black-and-white campus 30 years ago, it's now international. It mirrors society today.' - Jerry Wittiams (B.F.A. '71/A), writer, director and producer of commercials and videos the cutting edge of that. \" Borgard says. \"The univer- sity was doing card swipes to get into dorms and having 24/7 presence at the front door before lots of colleges and universities. \" At the same time, VCU's commitment to education continued as increased numbers of community college and transfer students found a home at the university. The university's population gi'adually shifted from mature working adults to more full-time coUege-age students. However, VCU still offered nontraditional students a place to earn an e.xemplai-)' higher education and created innovative new degree programs to suit them. Gale Crowder (B.G.S. '86/H&S), who volun- teers in the Richmond arts community, earned a Bachelor of General Studies — now called a Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies — after a 25~year hiatus in her education. \"It was a vei-y unique program origi- nally set up for older people who had some college or university but who hadn't finished. \" she says. While Crowder was nervous about returning to school, she felt welcome at VCU. In fact, she was often recognized around town. \"Never did it dawn on me that I stuck out, \" she says. \"One day 1 thought. \"I guess that's how they know me because 1 don't look like everyone else. \" VCU was and still is known for the individuality of its students. \"It used to be it was long hair and then it was piercings and now it's tattoos, but you still see the same kind of kids,\" says Jerry Williams (B.E.A. '71/A), a writer, director and producer of coinmer- cials and videos. \"The obvious change is the diversity. Where it was a black-and-white campus 30 years ago, it's now international.

You really don't think of one without the other.\" - David Batdacci (B.A. '85/I-I&S). best-selling author and VCU Board of Visitors member A 21st-century university By 1990, VCU ranked 64th among the top lOO federally funded research institutions. When Eugene P. Trani, Ph.D., became VCU s fourth president, he built on Ackell's vision and prepared the university to enter the 2Ist century with explosive growth in the areas of community outreach, research opportunities, and services and resources for students. \"The expansion of buildings and programs has allowed for a lot more diversity at VCU and has set the foundation for us to be a true player for years to come in so many different arenas.\" says Nina Sims (B.S. (j'^/MC), director of marketing and sales for the Community College Workforce Alliance. With a student body of 2I.OOO. more than double the size of what it was at the university's beginning, VCU needed room to expand. President Trani looked north toward Broad Street, which largely consisted of abandoned warehouses and storefronts. The $105 million investment into renovating the area, including building residence halls, a sports arena, a bookstore and an arts building, spurred more than $IOO million in private investment by developers. \"That's just a perfect example of where growth needs to occur to accommodate the university in an area that needed revitalization,\" says the Greater Richmond Partnership's Wingfield. \"It was a marriage that was a win-win on both sides.' VCU's development north included the creation of the Carver-VCU Partnership, a joint venture to build a safe and nurturing environment for those in the neigh- boring Cai-ver community. The VCU Police increased patrols while working with residents, and VCU students began mentoring the community's children. At the same time, four new residence halls, as well as expansion to the University Student Commons, allowed VCU to offer its students a more complete col- lege ex-perience. As an undergraduate living in Rhoads Hall and then Gladding Residence Center, Michelle Ferrera (M.S. 'Ol/AHP) appreciated what life in the residence halls had to offer. On the weekends, the university scheduled programs and events to keep stu- dents engaged, \"The university made the effort to give students a true campus feel, \" Ferrera says. Tlie continued gi'ovrth, recognition and sense of pur- pose created a feeling of pride across the university. \" It was the first time 1 felt there was a sense of shared aspirations, \" professor emeritus Van Winkle says. \"Suddenly, everybody had a very positive attitude about the place. People telt there was acknowledgment of successes, \" A TURNING POINT But \"the watershed moment \" for VCU, Keogh of the Virginia Chainber of Commerce says, occurred in 1995 with the establishment of the School of Engineering. \"TTiat was a veiy important public-private partnership between the commonwealth, the university and the business community, \" he says. \"The area begged for [an engineer- ing school] and they said they'd do it and they did it.\" Uniquely designed with a biomedical focus tied to the biotechnology and industrial needs of the Richmond region, the engineering school — a key component of President Trani's vision for VCU — followed on the heels of another economic endeavor.

The opening in 1995 of the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park, a partnership between VCU, the city of Richmond and the state, expanded the university's research possibilities and provided a catalyst for increased collaboration and economic development. Situated on 34 acres adjacent to the VCU Medical Center, the BioTech Park serves as the state's only science park dedi- cated exclusively to the advancement of biosciences. VCU soon began to place a stronger einphasis on this burgeoning area, and in 2000, launched a university- wide life sciences initiative that combined the resources and interests of the two campuses. \"Gene Trani has always said the past two centuries have been chemistry and physics and the 2 1st century is the century of life sciences,\" says Leonard Smock, Ph.D., VCU professor since 1979 ^i^d chairman of the Department of Biology since I990- With the creation of VCU Life Sciences, the link between the science departments and the MCV Campus strengthened. Additional facilities, such as the VCU Inger and Walter Rice Center for Environmental Life Sciences — a 342-acre living laboratory on the James River in Charles City County — offer even more chances for partnerships. Back in the city, the collocation of the schools of Business and Engineering exemplifies VCU's vision for increased collaboration among disciplines. A major component of VCU's largest capital campaign, which raised more than $410 million from 1999 'o 20o8, the Il-acre Monroe Park Campus Addition includes Snead Hall, home to the School of Business, and East Hall, the second building for the School of Engineering, joined by a student commons and shared facilities. THE NEXT CHAPTER The expansion of VCU's campuses has not only improved the university, but it also has sparked a surge in economic development in the city from the Fan to downtown. \"VCU has been the driving force, \" says David Baldacci (B.A. 'Ss/H&S), best-selling author and VCU Board of Visitors member. '1 tend to think of VCU and Richmond as sort of one entity now. You really don't think of one without the other. \" After 40 years of sustained growth, VCU contin- ues to move forward, at home and abroad. Today, VCU maintains partnerships with 16 international universities, including the VCU School of the Arts in Qatar. Additionally, the university opened campuses in Northern Virginia for the schools of Medicine. Pharmacy and Social Work and plans to further expand its mission locally, regionally and globally. \"I think we will continue to see a real strengthening of our research capabilities, our scholarly productivity,\" Smock says. We will continue to attract more and more of the top students and it will continue to get harder and harder to get into VCU.\" Additional growth vnW come, and as many of VCU's administrators, faculty and alumni know, evolution can happen quickly, spur change and lead to greatness. \"The last time I was at VCU, I noticed a lot of banners up, Ferrera says. \"1 thought, \"Wow! VCLl seems to be veiy proud.' The colors are showing. The banners are flying. Today when kids see all of the state-of-the-art facilities, that bodes well for the school.\" Enn Egan is a contnbuting writer Jor Shafer Court Connections. 18 I VCU Shafer Court Connections m^'- 1 .X^sdMH^fery marKS the donation of its namesake c5l ^ay Bonis Above, from left: Francii president. Margaret Freem Cabell and Maurice Duke- rendering of the proposed Tames Branch Cabe!! Librar The April 26, 1968, issue of Richmond Professional Institute's student newspaper, Prescript, announced plans to name the new Virginia Commonwealth University library after famed Richmond author James Branch Cabell. The reclusive writer gained national atten- tion in the 1920s after New York state attempted to suppress the publication of his romantic fantasy, \"Jurgen,\" on grounds that it was pornographic. A renewed interest in Cabell's writing 1 surfaced in the late 1960s - a decade after his death - just as plans for the new library were under way. In January 1967, Edgar MacDonald, Ph.D., (B.S. '52/H&S), an English profes- sor at Randoiph-Macon College, spoke I at the Woman's Club of Richmond ^ about Cabell's relevance to the city. E. Allan Brown, Ph.D., (1919-1985), chair of RPI's English department, attended the lecture and walked away with the idea to name the new library after Cabell. 'Allan was concerned that the proposed univer- sity or the new library might be named after Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr. or some other politician,\" says MacDonald, author of \"James Branch Cabell and Richmond-In-Virginia.\" That same year, RPI English professor Maurice Duke, Ph.D., began compiling a catalog of Cabell's 3,000-volume personal library for his dissertation. \"I personally handled and described every book in the collection,\" says Duke, now professor emeritus of English at VCU. \"I did all the work after meeting with classes each day i typed the whole [catalog] on the black marble-top table using Cabell's ancient type- writer, both of which are now in the Cabell Room\" on the library's fourth floor. Duke and MacDonald overwhelmingly supported Brown's naming campaign and so did RPI's Board of Visitors. \"Cabell would have been childishly delighted with the idea of a library named after him,\" MacDonald says. \"It would have meant a type of acceptance from Richmond that he didn't receive when he was alive.\" In the wake of the board's decision, Margaret Freeman Cabell, James Branch Cabell's second wife, donated the library's first collection — Cabell's exten- sive library, which includes F. Scott Fitzgerald first editions signed by the author and early editions of Mark Twain's work. In 1975, the collection and the Cabell Room opened to the university community along with the library's top three floors; the first floor opened in 1970. At the library's formal dedication, in 1976, then VCU President T Edward Temple, Ph.D., com- mented on the tremendous role libraries play in academic life: \"Without a library, there is indeed no university.\" Ray Bonis (B.S. '88/MC) is assistant archivist at the James Branch Cabell Library.

Fall 20p84 S^'TLmSS—: Annual gifts replenish the resources needed to offer education at an affordable cost When Debby Engelbrecht MacArthur (B.F.A. '72/A), a Connecticut-based jewelry designer, visited Richmond. Va.. recently, the Floyd Avenue apartment she called home during college looked exactly the same. But her alma mater sure didn't. \"The school looks wonderful, \" she says. \"1 couldn't believe how much it has expanded. \" In the 36 years since MacArthur grad- uated, Virginia Commonwealth University has undergone a major evolution. In 1968, the General Assembly fashioned VCU from the Medical College of Virginia and Richmond Professional Institute. At that time, the state-supported university offered lO.OOO students approximately 80 degree programs in 13 schools and two departments. Today, VCU enrolls more than 32,000 students in 205 certificate and degree programs in the arts, sciences and humanities. Sixty-five of the programs are unique in Virginia, many of them crossing the disciplines of VCU's 15 schools and one college. In addition, new buildings have sprouted up throughout the city and others have undergone significant renovations, dras- tically changing the landscape of VCU's campuses. As VCU has transformed, support from the commonwealth of Virginia has not kept pace, echoing a growing trend in higher education across the nation, says Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Stephen D, Gottfredson, Ph.D. 'When I began my career as a university educator, about 75 percent of any public university's budget came from its state's gen- eral fund, and about 25 percent came from all other sources. And by all other sources — I mean tuition and fees, I mean private gifts and endowments and I mean federal, state or industry grants and contracts for research and services,\" he says. \"Today, 30 years later, that picture is just about reversed: about 25 percent of a major public university's bud- get comes froiTi its state's general fund, and about 75 percent comes from those other sources,\" That's where alumni such as MacArthur help make a difference. For more than 20 years, MacArthur has made annual gifts of unrestricted dollars to the VCU School of the Arts. Now in a finan- cial position to give back, she says she sees it as an important responsibility. I read a lot, and I know schools cannot survive on tuition and state support alone, \" she says. Unrestricted annual gifts support the most-pressing initiatives at a certain time, such as student scholarships, improvements in clinical and classroom facilities, faculty support, technology advancements and more. Retired SunTrust executive Bill Ginther (B.S. '69/B; M.S. '74/B) reiterates the importance of annual giving in bridging the gap between the priorities funded by the state and the hopes and dreams of the university. \"VCU is state-supported, which means its budget is affected by the economy,\" he says, \"With the state budget, a lot of institutions are vying for the same dollars. As VCU con- tinues on its upward trajectory in terms of education, it just can't make many inroads relying on an ever-fluctuating state budget. \" Likewise, Gottfredson points out that families are being asked to foot more and more of the bill for higher education while students are having a tougher time borrow- ing money. \"Students from less affluent families are having a harder time attending college. \" he says. \"The average student leaving VCU today with an undergraduate degree takes with her an educational debt of more than $20,000. And the problem is only going to get worse. \" Ginther thinks it is time for more alumni to step up to the plate. There were people who were giving to VCU when was a student and providing for me. It is now my responsibility to provide. - Bill Ginther (B.S. '69/B: M.S. '74/B} 1 jg \"I have the belief that there were people who were giving to VCU when I was a student and providing for me, \" he says. \"It is now my responsibility to provide. \" U.S. News & World Report rankings heav- ily emphasize the percentage of alumni who give, says Ginther, a ineinber of the School of Business Foundation board of trustees. According to Ginther, VCU's record falls below other universities of its stature. \"If we could get a donation from every graduate.\" he says, \"we'd be in great shape.\" Melanie Irvm Solaimani (B.S.

If you've walked along or driven down the 900 block of West Franklin Street, just before you get to Shafer Street, on the right, you may have noticed a 14-foot-tall tower of brownstone-colored discs. \"Tableith,\" the first sculpture erected on the Monroe Park Campus in recognition of VCU's history, tells the story of Richmond Professional Institute, but the culmination of the project has an interesting story all of its own. Three years ago, a group of alumni, meeting to plan a larger-than-usual annual reunion, decided to recognize the begin- nings of RPI and its founder, Henry Hibbs, Ph.D. Established in 1917 — just before America entered World War I — to edu- cate social workers and public health nurses, RPI remained under Hibbs' lead- ership until the establishment of Virginia Commonwealth University in 1968. With a campus location for the commemora- tive sculpture provided by the university, the RPI alumni group established a com- mittee to plan a fundraising campaign, invite submissions from artists, and then judge and ultimately select the winning entrant. Today, 'Tableith,\" created by Richmond sculptor Charles Ponticello (M.F.A. '94/A), stands majestically between the historic Ginter House — or the \"Ad Building,\" short for the Administration Building — and the Scott House awaiting its formal dedication in October, during the celebration of VCU's 40th anniversary. Weighing more than 20 tons, \"Tableith\" consists of 51 cast discs representing RPI's growth from 1917 until the founding of VCU in 1968. Each disc represents a year in the life of RPI and features an inscription along the edge with a key event from that year. \"The solidarity and power of monolithic structures inscribed with information have been burned into our minds for centuries,\" Ponticello says. \"The marriage of object and text provides viewers a new and enlightening perspective of RPI. Viewers will experience a spiral tapestry that narrates the historical past of VCU. As the discs build upon one another, they merge and mesh into a strong, interlocking structure, symbolic of harmony, synchronicity and change.\" The final phase of the project will be a cobblestone terrace and landscaping around \"Tableith,\" utilizing the 300 origi- nal cobblestones saved from the repaving of the alley that led to the old library, now Anderson Gallery. All RPI alumni and friends, as well as VCU staff, faculty, students, parents and others are invited to attend the RPI Commemorative Sculpture Presentation on Saturday, Oct. 25, or view online at.

Fall 2008 I 2:^ Alumni benefit from reinvesting in their alma mater I Vine bacK what is the secret to making a gift to Virginia Commonwealth University that holds meaning for you and makes a lasting impact? A bequest. \"Bequests are a great way to ensure future excellence at VCU,\" says Tom Burke, executive director of the VCU Foundation. Because the needs of students and the university change each year, the unrestricted funds generated from bequests give the presi- dent flexibility to respond to the most pressing needs of the moment, Burke says. \"We are glad to be 'last in line' and are always thankful to be included in an alumnus's will or even considered for a bequest,\" he says. James Lester: Embracing opportunity Joseph Holicky III: Supporting student scholarship James Lester (B.S. '62/B), a former president of the RPI A three-degree alumnus of VCU and longtime state employee. Alumni Association, likes to stay involved with his alma mater Joseph Holicky III (B.S. '76/B; B.S. '77/HS,S; M.S. '78/B) recog- because engagement helps keep him sharp \"At 73' ^ \"^ very interested in staying mentally active. The more 1 stay involved, the more I learn and the better I am,\" he says. One way he has stayed connected is through the VCU Heritage Society. He and his wife, Faye. gained membership to this group by including VCU in their estate plan. The society offers mem- bers special opportunities for attending lectures, performances and other events. \"Planned giving allows you to determine what you would like the gift to support and lets you meet with your advisers to determine the most effective giving method for ta.x purposes,\" Lester says. \"This was the most efficient tax venue for our charitable giving and gives us flexibility during our lifetime.\" James Lester nizes the skyrocketing costs of education. \"The cost of education is in the strato- sphere,\" he says. \"There is no good or easy answer to making college education more affordable.\" To help make a difference for students, he and his wife, Irene Burlock, have established endowed scholarships in the schools of Business and Engineering. But they want to do more and plan to include VCU in their wills. Joseph Holicky III ,,-,., 1 , i 1 ■ 1 With scholarships, we can see the immediate impact and interact with our recipients,\" Holicky says. He says he hopes his planned gift, however, will continue to provide benefits to the university long after he's gone. \"The school has gone in unbelievable directions, \" he says. \"I'm proud to be part of the evolution.\" If you are interested in learning more about planned giving strategies and the benefits they can offer, contact Tom Burke, executive director of the VCU Foundation, at (804) 828-3958 or tcburke[USER].edu, or visit the VCU Foundation Web site at. 28 I VCU Shafer Court Connections Class notes Send information about your professional and personal accomplishments to shafercourt[USER].edu.

A proud Virginia Commonv/ealth University graduate, she continuously gives back to her alma mater, and talks here about v/hy it's important to stay involved after graduation. Why is it important for you to stay involved as a VCU alumna? We are ambassadors for the university and walking billboards. A university and a college are only as strong as their alumni base and we are the people who know the school best. For a school that did so much, it's important for me to stay involved. It's key to give back and pay it forward — those are core values for me. What was it like to be honored as the 2005 African-American Alumni Council Alumni of the Year? It was an honor. It's pretty remarkable and very humbling. There are alumni doing great things all over the world and they chose me; I didn't take that lightly.

Lower, M.D., who helped develop the tech- niques for transplanting a human heart and performed the ninth transplant in the U.S., died May 17, 2008, at his home in Twin Bridges, Mont. He was 78- Lower was a professor emeritus at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine and for- mer chair of the Division of Cardlothoracic Surgery. He came to the VCU Medical Center, then the Medical College of Virginia, in 1965 from Stanford University Medical Center. In Richmond, Lower and his research team nearly performed the first heart transplant in the world, but a blood incompatibility issue kept them from operating. On May 25, 1968, Lower performed the first heart transplant in Virginia — just the l6th in the world — and while the patient's survival was short, it led to a landmark change in the legal definition of brain death, a decision that would forever benefit future transplant recipients.

Engineering faculty focuses on a diverse future for students Rosalyn Hobson originally wanted to go to medical school. She planned to earn an undergraduate degree in engineering - thinking that would give her an edge over students majoring in biology or chemistry - but by the second year, her mindset changed. \"I'm curious about how things work, and engineering gave me the opportunity to figure that out,\" she says. Hobson, the associate dean for graduate studies at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Engineering, has been involved with the engineering program since its inception in the mid-'90s. She recently sat down with Shafer Court Connections to discuss the importance of diversity and global opportunities in this eve'r- changing field. Most recently more women are pursuing careers in engineering. Why is that diversity important? Diversity provides a lot of different perspectives on how to solve problems. If you look at population demographics, about half the world is females. Imagine a profession that is so important to progress and so important to making life better, still has half the population not really engaged in it or even thinking of it as a possible career choice. By bringing together a diverse group of people, including women, you can get innovative solutions. Why are international experiences important for you to participate in? Just like engineering was always part of my family, international experiences were, too. I'm fascinated with other cultures. I believe that we are citizens of the world because of the connectedness, the global interactions and the linkages of individuals and multinational companies. The decisions people make in one country not only impact their bordering countries but now affect economies around the world. We can't just live in our own corner, and I don't want to. What have been some of your international experiences? In 2001, I received my first in- ternational grant to facilitate a partnership with a university in South Africa. We've taken stu- dents to work in South Africa on research projects that were relevant to their studies. I was i an American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow and studied the role of science and technology in international development. I'm now the direc- tor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal partnership, one of VCU's 16 strategic international partnerships. Weddings 2000S Kim Miller (M.S.

(Hereinafter referred to as`this work\")CDOT and the City of Boulder believe it will be beneficial to perform this work because it will improve visibility by removing sight distance obstructions, slow bicyclists speeds on their approach to these intersections and reduce the number of crashes involving bicyclists and through vehicles. This work will conform to the parameters articulated in the Colorado Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, AASHTO\"A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets\",AASHTO\"Roadside Design Guide\",and the CDOT Project Development Manual, CDOT M&S Standards, CDOT Design Guide,CDOT Construction Manual, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices,Highway Capacity Manual,along with all applicable State and Federal guidelines. This work will consist of the straightening of 29°Street to intersect with Baseline Road at a right angle and detachment of the north multi-use path on the approach to the 291 Street intersection. Additional traffic signal infrastructure and the construction of a southbound right-tum lane to help reduce right-of-way conflicts between bicyclists and vehicles will be completed at the intersection of SH 93 and Rayleigh. There will also be new lane configurations for vehicle and bicyclist traffic at the intersection of Colorado Ave. and Regent Drive. The design phase of this work is scheduled to begin during federal fiscal year 2018.The design phase will identify more exact requirements, qualities, and attributes for this work. (Herein after referred to as `the exact work\"). The exact work shall be used to complete the construction phase of the project. The construction phase of the project is estimated to begin in federal fiscal year 2019 and shall finish as soon as reasonably possible. EXHIBIT B.

       "      <td>13. Lightmas For the two days following their arrival, there was a fury of activity throughout Westmark. Everyone wanted to see Aurei, to speak to her and especially to meet her aunt. In fact, Zeatt created quite a bit of gossip in the town when it was learned that she was from the Underdark. They were even more amazed when they met her and learned that she was a Bishop in the Church of Yesh and a charming, lovely person. But Zeatt, like Queen Eioldth, was deeply saddened and troubled by the state of affairs that had transpired. Queen Eioldth was devastated at the death of her beloved Orc guards. The following morning Aurei and Eleazar led a detachment to the teleportation portal platform, accompanied by the lovely Queen, who had tried to open the portal. But despite several attempts, the portal did not open. \"It has been destroyed.\" She told them and they went back to the town in despair. Zeatt took the Queen under her care, counseling her and encouraging her. Alis, who had befriended Eioldth on her first visit to Westmark, also ministered to the young Queen. Vinth fully recovered due to the healing spells of Zeatt, but like the Queen, he mourned the loss of his men. It was Eleazar, Aeric, Lute and especially Siris who comforted him, and he healed quickly both physically and emotionally. Krys, Brandi and the others were all thrilled to have Aurei back with them, and for those two days she was extremely busy catching up on both the business of the Duchy and the Muddy Boot. The seriousness of the political situation facing Haroldris in Northmarch, the fate of the Emperor and the empire, the looming danger to them all from the Necromancer's Guild, and the loss of life of several people Aurei knew, made the Drow girl feel heavily depressed. Snow was falling two days later when Aurei sat, late in the evening, in the tavern of the Muddy Boot after everyone had went off to bed. She was staring blankly at a pile of receipts for purchases of supplies for the tavern when footsteps on the stairs made her look up. It was Sir Eleazar, who had spent the day divided between duties at the Blood Knight's Keep and discussing with Pectros and the ducal guard how best to protect the city from any future threats. \"Hi.\" He greeted her quietly as he came over and sat down beside her. \"Hi. I haven't seen you all day.\" \"It has been very busy. We had a false alarm this afternoon - someone thought they saw an airship in the distance, but after watching it for a while, we determined it was only a cloud.\" Aurei breathed a sigh of relief, \"Thank Yesh for that. How's Vinth?\" \"He's doing fine. Orcs don't mourn for very long, and Queen Eioldth spoke to him for a long time at the Blood Knight Keep this evening which I think helped them both.\" \"She's really feeling responsible for the guard's deaths.\" Aurei informed him. \"It's not her fault.\" \"We know that, but she still blames herself. It may be crazy, but I sent a messenger off to King's Reach yesterday morning to tell the King what has happened. They both have those magic amulets that show the other one what is happening to them so they know what the other one knows, but I had to do something. She needs him, right now.\" \"He has to put the Kingdom first, unfortunately.\" \"Yes, and she understands this, but she still needs him.\" \"The poor lady; how hard to be an Elven woman, pregnant with your human husband's child, separated from him with danger all around.\" \"I'm afraid she feels helpless and hopeless, Laz.\" \"Well, there may be something in the works to lift her spirit.\" \"What?\" Aurei asked. Eleazar smiled, \"Have you ever heard of the festival of Lightmas?\" \"Lightmas? Of course, it's one of the most important holidays we have! Brother Darv loved to conduct the ceremony each year; the whole town greatly enjoyed the holiday.\" Aurei's eyes filled with tears as she thought of the dead priest. \"Did you realize that the festival of Lightmas is tomorrow?\" \"Tomorrow? No, I didn't - I've been so busy since we arrived here that I honestly had no idea of what day it is. Oh, well, it doesn't really matter anyway -- with Brother Darv gone, we don't have a priest to officiate over the ceremony, and without that, all that is left is the feast. I doubt anyone in town is too enthusiastic about that.\" \"What if I told you there would be a ceremony tomorrow in the village church?\" \"How? We have no-one to officiate.\" \"Yes you do - your aunt, Zeatt. It was her idea, actually. When she learned how much Brother Darv was missed, and how everyone had loved the Lightmas holiday, she decided everyone needed it.\" \"Can she do that?\" Eleazar gave her an incredulous look, \"Are you kidding? Aurei, she is a Bishop! She was one of 12 that conducted the High Lightmas ceremony in Aeropolis, in which tens of thousands attended. She certainly can handle a small city's ceremony.\" \"Oh yeah, I tend to forget she's a priestess of Yesh.\" Aurei smiled, \"That's wonderful; but what about the feast after the ceremony? Most of the celebration was held here at the Inn and we don't have time to get ready!\" \"Well, what if I told you that your aunt, the Most Reverend Mother, anticipated that and made plans behind your back to get things ready so that you could fully enjoy the holiday without worrying about preparations?\" Aurei's eyes shined, \"Really?!\" \"She has it all under control. Everything! All you need to do is to show up.\" \"But-\" \"Duchess Bugley, you must trust me, she has taken care of all of the preparations.\" \"But, I-\" \"Duchess…\" \"Well, you should have told me sooner!\" \"I wasn't supposed to tell you at all - I'll probably be excommunicated for letting it slip. She's doing this as a gift for you and for your town.\" Aurei stood up, wringing her hands nervously, \"I've always had so much to do just before Lightmas… I don't know this time what I'm supposed to do!\" \"That's easy. Put your papers away, go upstairs, get some sleep and just enjoy tomorrow.\" \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \"The Reverend Mother assigned me the tough task of making sure you get proper rest. So apparently I am supposed to lock you in your room and then stand guard outside the door to keep you from sneaking back out. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to make sure you are asleep.\" \"Maybe you are supposed to stay with me in my room.\" Aurei flirted, knowing it would upset the young half-Drow. \"I don't want to be excommunicated for that either.\" He nervously replied, a slight pinkness coming over his grey skin. \"Then I'll have to stay up and prepare for tomorrow.\" \"I'm telling you, there is nothing left to prepare.\" \"We'll see.\" Eleazar knew that she was determined to get her way, so he sat down as his mission was far from over. *** She awoke the following morning to the sound of church bells ringing. For a moment she was alarmed, for they were never sounded except during emergencies or during one of the three Holy days. But as she leaped out of bed and hurried to the window she recalled what day it was and relaxed somewhat. Glancing out into the cold winter morning, she was greeted with the image of a blizzard of lazy snowflakes that brought a wonderful peace to the scene. From other buildings, townspeople were looking out windows and doorways toward the church of Yesh. Apparently she wasn't the only person in town not told about the Lightmas ceremony. Turning away from the scene, she hurried to get dressed, for the bells always announced an hour before the ceremony was to begin. She had stayed in the Inn's large master bedroom - the room that had been her father's -- and thankfully she had taken most of her clothing over to the room so she could quickly get ready for the church service. Half an hour later she was dressed in her finest dress and stood waiting in the cold air on the front porch of the Muddy Boot, waving at the townspeople as they slowly tromped through the snow toward the church. Minutes later she was joined on the porch by Alis, Brandi and Krys, all three young women looking radiant in their finest apparel. They waited only a few moments before Queen Eioldth made her appearance, dressed in somber black, but - much to the four women's relief- with a smile on her face. \"Your Majesty, how are you this Lightmas morning?\" Aurei asked as she and the barmaids curtsied. \"I am well, Aurei; my look at the snow fall! How glorious. Shall we proceed to the church?\" The ladies joined the procession heading to the church. Aurei was very pleased to see the excited and happy expressions on the other residents of the town as they walked through the snow to the church building. As they mounted the steps to enter the sanctuary, they were joined by Vinth who was escorted by Lute, Siris and Thorm. All four bowed to the Queen, who greeted them warmly. \"Captain Vinth, I am very glad to see you joining this celebration today.\" Eioldth told the Orc Captain and he fell in behind her, ever mindful of his duty to his Queen. \"Get ready for a surprise.\" Alis whispered in Aurei's ear as they entered the church. She turned to her friend with a questioning look, but the half-Elf girl only nodded toward the front of the church. Just in front of the altar stood Zeatt, looking regal in the white and red vestments that had been Brother Darv's own. She spoke to a group of men standing there, and she recognized most of them, except for six knights who wore cloaks covered in melting snow. As they entered the men turned to face them. Suddenly Queen Eioldth let out a loud shout and sprinted toward the men. One of the knights threw his hood back and the young Queen jumped into his arms. It was King Haroldris. The assembled congregation erupted in applause. \"How could he have possibly got here so fast - I only sent the message two days ago?\" Aurei asked Alis as they went to greet the King. \"I don't know - he arrived about half an hour ago, apparently he started off from King's Reach shortly after the Queen and her guards fled.\" \"I hope this doesn't mean King's Reach has fallen!\" Alis didn't respond, and by then they had reached the King, so there was no further time for speculation. Soon they were all seated and the ceremony began. Lightmas commemorated the beginning of Yesh's ministry, where he announced to the world that he was bringing the Light of God into the world to save the world from damnation. Zeatt was truly amazing as she conducted the ceremony. She sang-chanted the appropriate words from the ceremony and then delivered a passionate and uplifting message that spoke of faith in the middle of adversity and strength during conflict. As the congregation sang the Lightmas hymns to Yesh in closing, everyone felt the dark mood that had blanketed the town had lifted, at least if just for this day. After they had left the church following the ceremony, Aurei walked along with the King and Queen. \"Your Highness, I am so thankful you joined us. I must admit that I was completely surprised to find you here so quickly - and in a snowstorm no less!\" Haroldris grinned, \"Duchess, I must confess that we didn't ride from King's Reach to Westmark. You see, the day after I sent my dear wife away for her safety, I received unexpected help from The Bitter Dregs. With their help, we were able to stabilize the situation there, though the rebels fled to the south. Before they left in pursuit of them, I asked the Sorceress with them if she could magically find where Eioldth was, and when she learned where she was, she offered to teleport us there by spell. That was apparently just after your group found the Faesidhe teleportation device upon Mount Kiee. When we arrived, the hillside was still on fire, though your adversaries were no-where to be found. The teleportation platform had been destroyed by the magic fire. I had the sad duty of identifying the remains of many of the Queens' guard and we feared you all might be dead. But the amulet that Eioldth wears allows me to see and hear what she does when I need to, and I knew she was safe with you in Westmark. So we rode hard from Mount Kiee to get here.\" \"We lost many fine Guards in that battle.\" Eioldth commented as she glanced back to the somber face of Vinth who walked behind her. The King turned to regard the Orc, \"But thank Yesh we did not lose Captain Vinth.\" The Orc shrugged, \"I would have perished had it not been for Duchess Bugley pulling me onto the teleportation platform. I owe, Her Grace, my life.\" \"You saved us from being overtaken by whoever was following us, so we are even, I'd say.\" \"I am curious,\" The King said to those walking with him and his queen, \"How did you know the device still worked?\" Aurei turned to Eleazar, who walked beside the Orc. \"Your Highness,\" The Half-Drow said, \"We received help from some sort of wizard. While we were trying to out-ride those following us, a man appeared in front of us, carrying a large book. He looked like a wizard, though he seemed rather young. He told us that the device was there and still active and then simply vanished. I don't know what to make of it.\" Haroldris wrinkled his brow, \"Sir Eleazar, was he a dark haired young man, perhaps carrying a white staff?\" \"He was dark haired, but he didn't carry a staff, only a book. Do you know him, your Majesty?\" \"I don't know him, Sir Eleazar, but I think I may have heard of him.\" \"Who is he?\" Eioldth and Aurei asked in unison. \"I can't know for sure, but it sounds like tales I've heard of Drake the Archmage.\" \"I've heard of that name!\" Aurei exclaimed, remembering the letter her father had sent to her that had detailed two wizards that had saved her as an infant from Faesidhe Elves who had sought to murder her. \"He is a legend, but there are sightings of him. He is a watcher, one of a handful of immortal guardians established by God before the Great Gathering to monitor the races. He is said to be the great grandson of another watcher, the Archmage Kinzer. She is said to appear as a tall, incredibly beautiful blonde woman… you didn't see such a woman with him, did you?\" \"No.\" Eleazar answered, \"He seemed to be alone.\" \"Kinzer is the author of the Great Book of the Races that details the events that transpired after the Great Gathering. It is said that Kinzer wears a ring that magically lessens her beauty so that everyone who views her won't be awestruck. Both she and Drake were once mortals before the time of the Great Gathering, but now they serve as watchers.\" \"So you think the man Eleazar saw was the Archmage Drake?\" Eioldth asked her husband. \"Who knows? It sounds similar to stories I've heard over the years of appearances of the man. At any rate, whoever he was gave you information that saved your lives, though it cost the lives of many valiant Queen's Guardsmen.\" They all walked in silence the remainder of the way to the Muddy Boot, where, to Aurei's delight, as Eleazar had told her, all was ready for the great feast. It was a joyous time, one that everyone would remember, the whole town tightly crowded in and around the Inn eating and making merry while some of the town musicians played lively tunes and many danced to their songs. In spite of the preparations, Aurei felt it was her duty to help Krys, Alis and Brandi serve, yet all of them were able to spend a considerable period of time relaxing and feasting. Alis sat with Sir Aeric much of the time, and it was obvious to everyone that both were deeply in love with each other. Vinth sat at a table with Lute, Siris, Thorm and a few of his Dwarven armorers and they kept the mood light for the Orc, who also seemed to enjoy himself to some degree, though the sadness never completely left his eyes. Pectros was absent, instead spending the day at the Keep, supposedly on ducal guard business, though, from what Alis and Krys had told him, he was very fascinated with the Sorceress that remained in chains in the Keep's dungeon. Aurei had not yet had time to bring the girl to trial for her part in the attack on them at Thurgood, nor had she interviewed the lady, who was kept in magical silence to prevent her from casting any of her spells. Pectros' infatuation with the lovely young woman troubled her, for he was the captain of her guard, but he also was a lonely man who had never wed, so she chose to at least allow him to dream of some sort of happiness for this holiday. Aurei, when not taking her turn waiting on the townspeople, sat at the King's table, with Haroldris, Eioldth, Zeatt and - at Aurei's insistence- Eleazar. The half-Drow seemed very awkward sitting with them and she did not know the reason for his discomfort, though she tried her best all during the short snowy day to encourage him to relax and enjoy himself. It was mid evening and the festivities had dwindled down when she had finished her round of serving and returned to the King's table only to find that Eleazar had excused himself while she was away. She found him on the Inn's front porch, wrapped in his cloak watching the snow fall. She paused for a moment before revealing her presence to him, for he seemed so sad and alone as he stood there in the dark, with only the candles in the windows of the Inn giving any light on the scene. For an instant she hesitated, wondering if there was anything she could say or do to make the sadness go away. She really liked the young Faesidhe/Drow and perhaps her interest in him was causing him discomfort due to his Knightly vows. Right now he seemed to need a friend more than anything. She quietly walked up beside him, \"You never get tired of watching the snow fall when you live here. I spend hours watching it come down. It's so soothing, but somehow at the same time it makes me feel rather sad.\" \"Yeah,\" he replied distantly. \"So what is bothering you, my friend?\" The title drew in his attention and he glanced over to her. She smiled simply, not wanting to imply anything with her glance or cause him any more discomfort. \"Do you really want me to tell you, Aurei?\" \"Yes, I do.\" He stared at her for an instant and she returned the gaze until he broke it. \"Okay then, I will. I'm experiencing a conflict.\" \"What sort of conflict?\" \"A conflict between my vows as a Blood Knight and… well…\" He looked very uncomfortable as he struggled to finish his sentence. \"It's alright, Laz, I understand.\" \"You do?\" He seemed both relieved and surprised. \"Yes. I don't want you to be tormented like that.\" \"Really?\" \"Of course not. I'm experiencing the same problem, and I'm rather scared too.\" \"Hopefully not of me.\" He smiled somewhat nervously. \"Well, yes, but I'm not sure exactly why. More of a nervousness around you, I'd say, rather than fear.\" \"I'm not sure how this all happened, do you?\" \"No, I really don't either. I just… um… well, I just feel so… happy… when you are around. I'm sorry, Laz, but I just want to be around you all the time. Yesh help me, I can't believe I'm telling you this! I must be going crazy. I feel so confused when I'm around you. I don't know why, but I just feel so… so… good, when I'm around you. I've had many friends, Laz, but somehow this is different. I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense and I don't want to come across wrong. But I really enjoy being around you, Laz.\" \"I… I feel… the same way. Aurei, to be honest with you, when I first boarded the Emperor's Airship, I had told myself it was to try to convince the man to do the right thing. But I did it to rescue you.\" He looked down at his feet. \"Oh, I knew that.\" She replied, \"I was so thankful to see you.\" \"Aurei, I am not really sure what I'm supposed to do. I have never had this sort of problem before, and I don't know how to fight it.\" \"Fight it? You make it sound like an enemy to defeat.\" \"I'm not sure what to call it, Aurei. All I can say for certain is that I seem… drawn to you. I… I don't know what to call it. I've never had a really close friend before; that could just be it… maybe, I don't know. I'm confused about it all. I was planning to head back to Aeropolis - to see if I could assist the Blood Knights in any way. That is my duty, I'd say. I'm sure I'm needed there. It is probably expected of me. But…\" \"But?\" She repeated as he nervously wrung his hands. \"I don't think I can leave you.\" He said in shame, not daring to look up at her. \"Good, I don't want you to. I know that is a problem due to your vows as a Paladin.\" \"Yes, it is a huge problem. That's my conflict… I don't know exactly what I feel, or if what I feel is right. I'm afraid I am failing as a Knight of the Blood. But the more that I'm around you, Aurei, the more I want to be around you. We're not supposed to have any sort of ties that bind us down. We can't have any close relationships. I-I mean such as friends… We're taught that this is a danger to a knight as it can cause us to focus on those we care about rather then our vows to Yesh. It can lead to weakness.\" \"Laz, I understand this, really I do. I plan on continuing training as a Paladin, so eventually I too will be expected to take the same vow. But can't we just stop trying to understand everything and just relax and see what happens? If it is Yesh's will that we serve him as Paladins under the oaths of the Blood Knights, then he will give us the wisdom and strength to figure out how best to serve him. Have faith in him.\" Eleazar sighed and nodded, \"Yes, you're right - we should both focus on being Paladins, not on developing a… friendship.\" \"Well, I didn't say that, I think we should just pray for Yesh's guidance, but at least be open and honest about what we are going through to each other. Maybe that will make us see things clearer.\" \"That sounds sensible. I'll be honest right now - the two times you kissed me on the day I rescued you- it really caused me some problems. I had never… um… n-n-never been kissed before. It really bothered me…\" \"Sorry.\" \"No, I mean I… I guess I liked it. I know I did, actually. That's the problem, Aurei, it… I don't know… I enjoyed it but I don't think I was supposed to…\" \"Well, I hadn't kissed anyone before either, other than Mother and Father Bugley. I'm sorry; I really don't know what came over me. It was kind of weird, but I… I liked it too.\" \"Paladins don't kiss fellow Paladins. I don't think even friends kiss other friends… I don't know, really.\" Eleazar looked like a stretched bow string, nervously wringing his hands. \"You've never kissed Sir Aeric?\" Aurei joked nervously. \"Uh, no.\" \"What about his relationship with Alis?\" \"Well, that is troubling too!\" \"He seems not to have as much trouble with it.\" \"That actually might mean he has more to worry about if he isn't experiencing a conflict.\" \"But if he is happy, is that so bad?\" \"He's a Paladin.\" \"But he's also a man, and Alis is a lovely girl.\" \"Yes, but his affection for her can be used by an enemy to ensnare him. Love is even more dangerous then friendship.\" \"So you are saying that loving someone is dangerous?\" \"Yes… in a sense, it is.\" \"But Yesh taught that love is the greatest gift we can give another person.\" \"He wasn't talking about Romantic love.\" \"But was he excluding it?\" Eleazar started to answer, but paused, for he wasn't sure. Aurei took his hand and came in close to him. \"Laz, I really don't want to cause you any kind of conflict. I hate that, because I can clearly see that you are made to be a knight, and not just any knight but a leader of knights. I don't understand why I… have feelings… for you. But I do, and that is not going to change. I don't know what these feelings are, Laz. I feel really strange, but I do know I need you to be my friend, and I want you to stay here. I really feel happy when we're together. But I'm also not going to try to force you to feel anything that will make you feel guilty or uncomfortable to your vows. I would suggest that you just consider me your friend - a close, dear friend- until you feel in your heart what you are supposed to do. I'll wait until you have the answer.\" \"And you will accept it even if it means rejecting you and going back to Aeropolis?\" \"No, then I will beat the tar out of you and have you locked up in my dungeon where I will keep you forever.\" They both laughed and he smiled down at her. Her beautiful red eyes were glowing brightly in the dim candle light. The look she was giving him made him wonder if she really was as open-minded as she claimed to be to any decision he would make. She'd led an odd life, living among humans; this was probably her first case of puppy love. He was from 'out there' in the 'great big world' and was the first Drow she had met. He fascinated her, because he was different. One day she'd realize how silly the feelings she thought she felt for him were, but if he was careful, they could remain friends. He loved the thought of her as his friend. \"So until then we'll just be friends?\" \"Sure.\" Suddenly she leaned in, and before he knew it she was kissing him again, this time with her arms wrapped around his neck. He didn't even try to resist but pulled her close, feeling the delightful warmth of her body. Just when he thought he'd gotten their relationship straightened out. The kiss lasted nearly a minute and then she gently pulled away, her eyes sparkling brightly, \"There you go, 'Buddy', Happy Lightmas! Tomorrow morning I want you and the others who were with us at Thurgood to have a little chat with that Sorceress we have locked up to see if she has any idea on what is going on. Maybe we can figure out something to help the Blood Knights in Aeropolis as well as King Haroldris. Now come on, let's go back inside and enjoy the rest of this holiday, because tomorrow I'm not going to flirt with you anymore; I'll be focused on nothing but business.\" Taking his hand in hers, she pulled him back into the Muddy Boot, and though he told himself he still had a decision to make about where his loyalty rested, he knew in his heart that he had already made that decision. Yesh help him. | | Add to reading list</td>\n",

       "      <td>A selection of our photographs that we consider are One of the positives of the pandemic for us personally, and there haven’t been many that’s for sure, is that we have been able to order and absorb lots of reference books. In one form or another, all of them have a connection to what we are interested in looking for when we are on the road, namely architecture, Soviet/socialist-era relics, abandoned places and street art. The one exception in our ever-growing pile was a coffee-table book we ordered entitled Accidentally Wes Anderson by Wally Koval. Trying not to be stereotypical, but when you order books like Concrete Siberia (published by Zupagrafika) and Phaidon’s humongous Atlas of Brutalist Architecture, in which all of the buildings featured are in black and white, a brightly-coloured volume containing some of the most visually-striking structures and landscapes on the planet stands out like a sore thumb. Wes Anderson’s films are great. They might not be everyone’s cup of tea but if, like us, you are a fan then you will know that the enchanting, and often surreal locations for many of the backdrops in his movies are as integral to the film as, say, the plot, the distinctive fashion sense and the recurring use of his favourite actors such as Bill Murray (8 films), Owen Wilson (7 films) and Anjelica Huston (3 films), as examples. There are many, many scenes in Wes Anderson’s films where you think “I want to go there” and if Mark and I are watching one of his movies, it is not uncommon for us to pause it here and there whilst we figure out where the setting might be. The 2014 Grand Budapest Hotel is probably the movie in which we have done this the most. Who wouldn’t want to stay in the beguiling alpine resort in the fictional country of Zubrowka, in real life a defunct department store in Görlitz, Germany? Equally, Mendl’s cake shop, which also features prominently in the motion picture, is another irresistible location that actually is a functional bakery and dairy shop (Pfunds Dairy) in the east German city of Dresden. But, we also haven’t managed to watch either The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) or The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) without hitting the pause button and going off on a tangent to figure out some of the quirky places in which either of the movies were shot. And because we know the Indian city of Jodhpur and Udaipur fairly well, which is where The Darjeeling Limited (2007) was predominately filmed, it took us considerably longer than the 91-minutes running time to finish that particular movie. The Accidentally Wes Anderson book, which was published in October 2020, doesn’t focus on actual locations used in any of the films. Rather, it’s a collection of places and scenes that potentially tick all the right boxes to be featured in a Wes Anderson screenplay. Places that are visually striking, hark back to a bygone era, and are abstract and eccentric, for example, are all good starting points. Colour, particularly pastels, also play an important role in defining a possible candidate for a Wes Anderson film set, as does symmetry, dreamlike and darn right weirdness. Sunshine and lots of blue sky are also considerations. More importantly, they are images that we think fit the criteria for the growing movement of . The book’s introduction begins with the words “YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT”. If you travel and you are into Wes Anderson’s movies then this statement hits the spot perfectly. We’ve certainly seen buildings and the like and thought they would be good backdrops for a film by Wes Anderson, and we aren’t alone. The accidentallywesanderson Instagram account, by the same author, and the phenomena behind the book, has 1.3 million-plus followers and the hashtag, where anyone can post their photos, features more than 183,000 posts. And the whole Accidentally Wes Anderson theme is endorsed by the film director himself. There are some really stunning images in the book (plus great descriptions) and I would urge anyone interested in Wes Anderson’s movies to purchase a copy. My only gripe is that, at the moment, it is a rather sadistic publication to be thumbing through given there are very few/zero-travel opportunities on the foreseeable horizon! Keeping in mind the above criteria, what follows is our (more modest) collections of locations that we think ‘accidentally’ capture the essence of a scene for a Wes Anderson movie. Our explanations are brief – as the saying goes, “YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT” … And finally, during the course of putting this post together, I have worked out what our ideal job would be.

       "32  13. Lightmas For the two days following their arrival, there was a fury of activity throughout Westmark. Everyone wanted to see Aurei, to speak to her and especially to meet her aunt. In fact, Zeatt created quite a bit of gossip in the town when it was learned that she was from the Underdark. They were even more amazed when they met her and learned that she was a Bishop in the Church of Yesh and a charming, lovely person. But Zeatt, like Queen Eioldth, was deeply saddened and troubled by the state of affairs that had transpired. Queen Eioldth was devastated at the death of her beloved Orc guards. The following morning Aurei and Eleazar led a detachment to the teleportation portal platform, accompanied by the lovely Queen, who had tried to open the portal. But despite several attempts, the portal did not open. \"It has been destroyed.\" She told them and they went back to the town in despair. Zeatt took the Queen under her care, counseling her and encouraging her. Alis, who had befriended Eioldth on her first visit to Westmark, also ministered to the young Queen. Vinth fully recovered due to the healing spells of Zeatt, but like the Queen, he mourned the loss of his men. It was Eleazar, Aeric, Lute and especially Siris who comforted him, and he healed quickly both physically and emotionally. Krys, Brandi and the others were all thrilled to have Aurei back with them, and for those two days she was extremely busy catching up on both the business of the Duchy and the Muddy Boot. The seriousness of the political situation facing Haroldris in Northmarch, the fate of the Emperor and the empire, the looming danger to them all from the Necromancer's Guild, and the loss of life of several people Aurei knew, made the Drow girl feel heavily depressed. Snow was falling two days later when Aurei sat, late in the evening, in the tavern of the Muddy Boot after everyone had went off to bed. She was staring blankly at a pile of receipts for purchases of supplies for the tavern when footsteps on the stairs made her look up. It was Sir Eleazar, who had spent the day divided between duties at the Blood Knight's Keep and discussing with Pectros and the ducal guard how best to protect the city from any future threats. \"Hi.\" He greeted her quietly as he came over and sat down beside her. \"Hi. I haven't seen you all day.\" \"It has been very busy. We had a false alarm this afternoon - someone thought they saw an airship in the distance, but after watching it for a while, we determined it was only a cloud.\" Aurei breathed a sigh of relief, \"Thank Yesh for that. How's Vinth?\" \"He's doing fine. Orcs don't mourn for very long, and Queen Eioldth spoke to him for a long time at the Blood Knight Keep this evening which I think helped them both.\" \"She's really feeling responsible for the guard's deaths.\" Aurei informed him. \"It's not her fault.\" \"We know that, but she still blames herself. It may be crazy, but I sent a messenger off to King's Reach yesterday morning to tell the King what has happened. They both have those magic amulets that show the other one what is happening to them so they know what the other one knows, but I had to do something. She needs him, right now.\" \"He has to put the Kingdom first, unfortunately.\" \"Yes, and she understands this, but she still needs him.\" \"The poor lady; how hard to be an Elven woman, pregnant with your human husband's child, separated from him with danger all around.\" \"I'm afraid she feels helpless and hopeless, Laz.\" \"Well, there may be something in the works to lift her spirit.\" \"What?\" Aurei asked. Eleazar smiled, \"Have you ever heard of the festival of Lightmas?\" \"Lightmas? Of course, it's one of the most important holidays we have! Brother Darv loved to conduct the ceremony each year; the whole town greatly enjoyed the holiday.\" Aurei's eyes filled with tears as she thought of the dead priest. \"Did you realize that the festival of Lightmas is tomorrow?\" \"Tomorrow? No, I didn't - I've been so busy since we arrived here that I honestly had no idea of what day it is. Oh, well, it doesn't really matter anyway -- with Brother Darv gone, we don't have a priest to officiate over the ceremony, and without that, all that is left is the feast. I doubt anyone in town is too enthusiastic about that.\" \"What if I told you there would be a ceremony tomorrow in the village church?\" \"How? We have no-one to officiate.\" \"Yes you do - your aunt, Zeatt. It was her idea, actually. When she learned how much Brother Darv was missed, and how everyone had loved the Lightmas holiday, she decided everyone needed it.\" \"Can she do that?\" Eleazar gave her an incredulous look, \"Are you kidding? Aurei, she is a Bishop! She was one of 12 that conducted the High Lightmas ceremony in Aeropolis, in which tens of thousands attended. She certainly can handle a small city's ceremony.\" \"Oh yeah, I tend to forget she's a priestess of Yesh.\" Aurei smiled, \"That's wonderful; but what about the feast after the ceremony? Most of the celebration was held here at the Inn and we don't have time to get ready!\" \"Well, what if I told you that your aunt, the Most Reverend Mother, anticipated that and made plans behind your back to get things ready so that you could fully enjoy the holiday without worrying about preparations?\" Aurei's eyes shined, \"Really?!\" \"She has it all under control. Everything! All you need to do is to show up.\" \"But-\" \"Duchess Bugley, you must trust me, she has taken care of all of the preparations.\" \"But, I-\" \"Duchess…\" \"Well, you should have told me sooner!\" \"I wasn't supposed to tell you at all - I'll probably be excommunicated for letting it slip. She's doing this as a gift for you and for your town.\" Aurei stood up, wringing her hands nervously, \"I've always had so much to do just before Lightmas… I don't know this time what I'm supposed to do!\" \"That's easy. Put your papers away, go upstairs, get some sleep and just enjoy tomorrow.\" \"Well, what are you going to do?\" \"The Reverend Mother assigned me the tough task of making sure you get proper rest. So apparently I am supposed to lock you in your room and then stand guard outside the door to keep you from sneaking back out. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to make sure you are asleep.\" \"Maybe you are supposed to stay with me in my room.\" Aurei flirted, knowing it would upset the young half-Drow. \"I don't want to be excommunicated for that either.\" He nervously replied, a slight pinkness coming over his grey skin. \"Then I'll have to stay up and prepare for tomorrow.\" \"I'm telling you, there is nothing left to prepare.\" \"We'll see.\" Eleazar knew that she was determined to get her way, so he sat down as his mission was far from over. *** She awoke the following morning to the sound of church bells ringing. For a moment she was alarmed, for they were never sounded except during emergencies or during one of the three Holy days. But as she leaped out of bed and hurried to the window she recalled what day it was and relaxed somewhat. Glancing out into the cold winter morning, she was greeted with the image of a blizzard of lazy snowflakes that brought a wonderful peace to the scene. From other buildings, townspeople were looking out windows and doorways toward the church of Yesh. Apparently she wasn't the only person in town not told about the Lightmas ceremony. Turning away from the scene, she hurried to get dressed, for the bells always announced an hour before the ceremony was to begin. She had stayed in the Inn's large master bedroom - the room that had been her father's -- and thankfully she had taken most of her clothing over to the room so she could quickly get ready for the church service. Half an hour later she was dressed in her finest dress and stood waiting in the cold air on the front porch of the Muddy Boot, waving at the townspeople as they slowly tromped through the snow toward the church. Minutes later she was joined on the porch by Alis, Brandi and Krys, all three young women looking radiant in their finest apparel. They waited only a few moments before Queen Eioldth made her appearance, dressed in somber black, but - much to the four women's relief- with a smile on her face. \"Your Majesty, how are you this Lightmas morning?\" Aurei asked as she and the barmaids curtsied. \"I am well, Aurei; my look at the snow fall! How glorious. Shall we proceed to the church?\" The ladies joined the procession heading to the church. Aurei was very pleased to see the excited and happy expressions on the other residents of the town as they walked through the snow to the church building. As they mounted the steps to enter the sanctuary, they were joined by Vinth who was escorted by Lute, Siris and Thorm. All four bowed to the Queen, who greeted them warmly. \"Captain Vinth, I am very glad to see you joining this celebration today.\" Eioldth told the Orc Captain and he fell in behind her, ever mindful of his duty to his Queen. \"Get ready for a surprise.\" Alis whispered in Aurei's ear as they entered the church. She turned to her friend with a questioning look, but the half-Elf girl only nodded toward the front of the church. Just in front of the altar stood Zeatt, looking regal in the white and red vestments that had been Brother Darv's own. She spoke to a group of men standing there, and she recognized most of them, except for six knights who wore cloaks covered in melting snow. As they entered the men turned to face them. Suddenly Queen Eioldth let out a loud shout and sprinted toward the men. One of the knights threw his hood back and the young Queen jumped into his arms. It was King Haroldris. The assembled congregation erupted in applause. \"How could he have possibly got here so fast - I only sent the message two days ago?\" Aurei asked Alis as they went to greet the King. \"I don't know - he arrived about half an hour ago, apparently he started off from King's Reach shortly after the Queen and her guards fled.\" \"I hope this doesn't mean King's Reach has fallen!\" Alis didn't respond, and by then they had reached the King, so there was no further time for speculation. Soon they were all seated and the ceremony began. Lightmas commemorated the beginning of Yesh's ministry, where he announced to the world that he was bringing the Light of God into the world to save the world from damnation. Zeatt was truly amazing as she conducted the ceremony. She sang-chanted the appropriate words from the ceremony and then delivered a passionate and uplifting message that spoke of faith in the middle of adversity and strength during conflict. As the congregation sang the Lightmas hymns to Yesh in closing, everyone felt the dark mood that had blanketed the town had lifted, at least if just for this day. After they had left the church following the ceremony, Aurei walked along with the King and Queen. \"Your Highness, I am so thankful you joined us. I must admit that I was completely surprised to find you here so quickly - and in a snowstorm no less!\" Haroldris grinned, \"Duchess, I must confess that we didn't ride from King's Reach to Westmark. You see, the day after I sent my dear wife away for her safety, I received unexpected help from The Bitter Dregs. With their help, we were able to stabilize the situation there, though the rebels fled to the south. Before they left in pursuit of them, I asked the Sorceress with them if she could magically find where Eioldth was, and when she learned where she was, she offered to teleport us there by spell. That was apparently just after your group found the Faesidhe teleportation device upon Mount Kiee. When we arrived, the hillside was still on fire, though your adversaries were no-where to be found. The teleportation platform had been destroyed by the magic fire. I had the sad duty of identifying the remains of many of the Queens' guard and we feared you all might be dead. But the amulet that Eioldth wears allows me to see and hear what she does when I need to, and I knew she was safe with you in Westmark. So we rode hard from Mount Kiee to get here.\" \"We lost many fine Guards in that battle.\" Eioldth commented as she glanced back to the somber face of Vinth who walked behind her. The King turned to regard the Orc, \"But thank Yesh we did not lose Captain Vinth.\" The Orc shrugged, \"I would have perished had it not been for Duchess Bugley pulling me onto the teleportation platform. I owe, Her Grace, my life.\" \"You saved us from being overtaken by whoever was following us, so we are even, I'd say.\" \"I am curious,\" The King said to those walking with him and his queen, \"How did you know the device still worked?\" Aurei turned to Eleazar, who walked beside the Orc. \"Your Highness,\" The Half-Drow said, \"We received help from some sort of wizard. While we were trying to out-ride those following us, a man appeared in front of us, carrying a large book. He looked like a wizard, though he seemed rather young. He told us that the device was there and still active and then simply vanished. I don't know what to make of it.\" Haroldris wrinkled his brow, \"Sir Eleazar, was he a dark haired young man, perhaps carrying a white staff?\" \"He was dark haired, but he didn't carry a staff, only a book. Do you know him, your Majesty?\" \"I don't know him, Sir Eleazar, but I think I may have heard of him.\" \"Who is he?\" Eioldth and Aurei asked in unison. \"I can't know for sure, but it sounds like tales I've heard of Drake the Archmage.\" \"I've heard of that name!\" Aurei exclaimed, remembering the letter her father had sent to her that had detailed two wizards that had saved her as an infant from Faesidhe Elves who had sought to murder her. \"He is a legend, but there are sightings of him. He is a watcher, one of a handful of immortal guardians established by God before the Great Gathering to monitor the races. He is said to be the great grandson of another watcher, the Archmage Kinzer. She is said to appear as a tall, incredibly beautiful blonde woman… you didn't see such a woman with him, did you?\" \"No.\" Eleazar answered, \"He seemed to be alone.\" \"Kinzer is the author of the Great Book of the Races that details the events that transpired after the Great Gathering. It is said that Kinzer wears a ring that magically lessens her beauty so that everyone who views her won't be awestruck. Both she and Drake were once mortals before the time of the Great Gathering, but now they serve as watchers.\" \"So you think the man Eleazar saw was the Archmage Drake?\" Eioldth asked her husband. \"Who knows? It sounds similar to stories I've heard over the years of appearances of the man. At any rate, whoever he was gave you information that saved your lives, though it cost the lives of many valiant Queen's Guardsmen.\" They all walked in silence the remainder of the way to the Muddy Boot, where, to Aurei's delight, as Eleazar had told her, all was ready for the great feast. It was a joyous time, one that everyone would remember, the whole town tightly crowded in and around the Inn eating and making merry while some of the town musicians played lively tunes and many danced to their songs. In spite of the preparations, Aurei felt it was her duty to help Krys, Alis and Brandi serve, yet all of them were able to spend a considerable period of time relaxing and feasting. Alis sat with Sir Aeric much of the time, and it was obvious to everyone that both were deeply in love with each other. Vinth sat at a table with Lute, Siris, Thorm and a few of his Dwarven armorers and they kept the mood light for the Orc, who also seemed to enjoy himself to some degree, though the sadness never completely left his eyes. Pectros was absent, instead spending the day at the Keep, supposedly on ducal guard business, though, from what Alis and Krys had told him, he was very fascinated with the Sorceress that remained in chains in the Keep's dungeon. Aurei had not yet had time to bring the girl to trial for her part in the attack on them at Thurgood, nor had she interviewed the lady, who was kept in magical silence to prevent her from casting any of her spells. Pectros' infatuation with the lovely young woman troubled her, for he was the captain of her guard, but he also was a lonely man who had never wed, so she chose to at least allow him to dream of some sort of happiness for this holiday. Aurei, when not taking her turn waiting on the townspeople, sat at the King's table, with Haroldris, Eioldth, Zeatt and - at Aurei's insistence- Eleazar. The half-Drow seemed very awkward sitting with them and she did not know the reason for his discomfort, though she tried her best all during the short snowy day to encourage him to relax and enjoy himself. It was mid evening and the festivities had dwindled down when she had finished her round of serving and returned to the King's table only to find that Eleazar had excused himself while she was away. She found him on the Inn's front porch, wrapped in his cloak watching the snow fall. She paused for a moment before revealing her presence to him, for he seemed so sad and alone as he stood there in the dark, with only the candles in the windows of the Inn giving any light on the scene. For an instant she hesitated, wondering if there was anything she could say or do to make the sadness go away. She really liked the young Faesidhe/Drow and perhaps her interest in him was causing him discomfort due to his Knightly vows. Right now he seemed to need a friend more than anything. She quietly walked up beside him, \"You never get tired of watching the snow fall when you live here. I spend hours watching it come down. It's so soothing, but somehow at the same time it makes me feel rather sad.\" \"Yeah,\" he replied distantly. \"So what is bothering you, my friend?\" The title drew in his attention and he glanced over to her. She smiled simply, not wanting to imply anything with her glance or cause him any more discomfort. \"Do you really want me to tell you, Aurei?\" \"Yes, I do.\" He stared at her for an instant and she returned the gaze until he broke it. \"Okay then, I will. I'm experiencing a conflict.\" \"What sort of conflict?\" \"A conflict between my vows as a Blood Knight and… well…\" He looked very uncomfortable as he struggled to finish his sentence. \"It's alright, Laz, I understand.\" \"You do?\" He seemed both relieved and surprised. \"Yes. I don't want you to be tormented like that.\" \"Really?\" \"Of course not. I'm experiencing the same problem, and I'm rather scared too.\" \"Hopefully not of me.\" He smiled somewhat nervously. \"Well, yes, but I'm not sure exactly why. More of a nervousness around you, I'd say, rather than fear.\" \"I'm not sure how this all happened, do you?\" \"No, I really don't either. I just… um… well, I just feel so… happy… when you are around. I'm sorry, Laz, but I just want to be around you all the time. Yesh help me, I can't believe I'm telling you this! I must be going crazy. I feel so confused when I'm around you. I don't know why, but I just feel so… so… good, when I'm around you. I've had many friends, Laz, but somehow this is different. I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense and I don't want to come across wrong. But I really enjoy being around you, Laz.\" \"I… I feel… the same way. Aurei, to be honest with you, when I first boarded the Emperor's Airship, I had told myself it was to try to convince the man to do the right thing. But I did it to rescue you.\" He looked down at his feet. \"Oh, I knew that.\" She replied, \"I was so thankful to see you.\" \"Aurei, I am not really sure what I'm supposed to do. I have never had this sort of problem before, and I don't know how to fight it.\" \"Fight it? You make it sound like an enemy to defeat.\" \"I'm not sure what to call it, Aurei. All I can say for certain is that I seem… drawn to you. I… I don't know what to call it. I've never had a really close friend before; that could just be it… maybe, I don't know. I'm confused about it all. I was planning to head back to Aeropolis - to see if I could assist the Blood Knights in any way. That is my duty, I'd say. I'm sure I'm needed there. It is probably expected of me. But…\" \"But?\" She repeated as he nervously wrung his hands. \"I don't think I can leave you.\" He said in shame, not daring to look up at her. \"Good, I don't want you to. I know that is a problem due to your vows as a Paladin.\" \"Yes, it is a huge problem. That's my conflict… I don't know exactly what I feel, or if what I feel is right. I'm afraid I am failing as a Knight of the Blood. But the more that I'm around you, Aurei, the more I want to be around you. We're not supposed to have any sort of ties that bind us down. We can't have any close relationships. I-I mean such as friends… We're taught that this is a danger to a knight as it can cause us to focus on those we care about rather then our vows to Yesh. It can lead to weakness.\" \"Laz, I understand this, really I do. I plan on continuing training as a Paladin, so eventually I too will be expected to take the same vow. But can't we just stop trying to understand everything and just relax and see what happens? If it is Yesh's will that we serve him as Paladins under the oaths of the Blood Knights, then he will give us the wisdom and strength to figure out how best to serve him. Have faith in him.\" Eleazar sighed and nodded, \"Yes, you're right - we should both focus on being Paladins, not on developing a… friendship.\" \"Well, I didn't say that, I think we should just pray for Yesh's guidance, but at least be open and honest about what we are going through to each other. Maybe that will make us see things clearer.\" \"That sounds sensible. I'll be honest right now - the two times you kissed me on the day I rescued you- it really caused me some problems. I had never… um… n-n-never been kissed before. It really bothered me…\" \"Sorry.\" \"No, I mean I… I guess I liked it. I know I did, actually. That's the problem, Aurei, it… I don't know… I enjoyed it but I don't think I was supposed to…\" \"Well, I hadn't kissed anyone before either, other than Mother and Father Bugley. I'm sorry; I really don't know what came over me. It was kind of weird, but I… I liked it too.\" \"Paladins don't kiss fellow Paladins. I don't think even friends kiss other friends… I don't know, really.\" Eleazar looked like a stretched bow string, nervously wringing his hands. \"You've never kissed Sir Aeric?\" Aurei joked nervously. \"Uh, no.\" \"What about his relationship with Alis?\" \"Well, that is troubling too!\" \"He seems not to have as much trouble with it.\" \"That actually might mean he has more to worry about if he isn't experiencing a conflict.\" \"But if he is happy, is that so bad?\" \"He's a Paladin.\" \"But he's also a man, and Alis is a lovely girl.\" \"Yes, but his affection for her can be used by an enemy to ensnare him. Love is even more dangerous then friendship.\" \"So you are saying that loving someone is dangerous?\" \"Yes… in a sense, it is.\" \"But Yesh taught that love is the greatest gift we can give another person.\" \"He wasn't talking about Romantic love.\" \"But was he excluding it?\" Eleazar started to answer, but paused, for he wasn't sure. Aurei took his hand and came in close to him. \"Laz, I really don't want to cause you any kind of conflict. I hate that, because I can clearly see that you are made to be a knight, and not just any knight but a leader of knights. I don't understand why I… have feelings… for you. But I do, and that is not going to change. I don't know what these feelings are, Laz. I feel really strange, but I do know I need you to be my friend, and I want you to stay here. I really feel happy when we're together. But I'm also not going to try to force you to feel anything that will make you feel guilty or uncomfortable to your vows. I would suggest that you just consider me your friend - a close, dear friend- until you feel in your heart what you are supposed to do. I'll wait until you have the answer.\" \"And you will accept it even if it means rejecting you and going back to Aeropolis?\" \"No, then I will beat the tar out of you and have you locked up in my dungeon where I will keep you forever.\" They both laughed and he smiled down at her. Her beautiful red eyes were glowing brightly in the dim candle light. The look she was giving him made him wonder if she really was as open-minded as she claimed to be to any decision he would make. She'd led an odd life, living among humans; this was probably her first case of puppy love. He was from 'out there' in the 'great big world' and was the first Drow she had met. He fascinated her, because he was different. One day she'd realize how silly the feelings she thought she felt for him were, but if he was careful, they could remain friends. He loved the thought of her as his friend. \"So until then we'll just be friends?\" \"Sure.\" Suddenly she leaned in, and before he knew it she was kissing him again, this time with her arms wrapped around his neck. He didn't even try to resist but pulled her close, feeling the delightful warmth of her body. Just when he thought he'd gotten their relationship straightened out. The kiss lasted nearly a minute and then she gently pulled away, her eyes sparkling brightly, \"There you go, 'Buddy', Happy Lightmas! Tomorrow morning I want you and the others who were with us at Thurgood to have a little chat with that Sorceress we have locked up to see if she has any idea on what is going on. Maybe we can figure out something to help the Blood Knights in Aeropolis as well as King Haroldris. Now come on, let's go back inside and enjoy the rest of this holiday, because tomorrow I'm not going to flirt with you anymore; I'll be focused on nothing but business.\" Taking his hand in hers, she pulled him back into the Muddy Boot, and though he told himself he still had a decision to make about where his loyalty rested, he knew in his heart that he had already made that decision. Yesh help him. | | Add to reading list   \n",

                                                  A selection of our photographs that we consider are One of the positives of the pandemic for us personally, and there haven’t been many that’s for sure, is that we have been able to order and absorb lots of reference books. In one form or another, all of them have a connection to what we are interested in looking for when we are on the road, namely architecture, Soviet/socialist-era relics, abandoned places and street art. The one exception in our ever-growing pile was a coffee-table book we ordered entitled Accidentally Wes Anderson by Wally Koval. Trying not to be stereotypical, but when you order books like Concrete Siberia (published by Zupagrafika) and Phaidon’s humongous Atlas of Brutalist Architecture, in which all of the buildings featured are in black and white, a brightly-coloured volume containing some of the most visually-striking structures and landscapes on the planet stands out like a sore thumb. Wes Anderson’s films are great. They might not be everyone’s cup of tea but if, like us, you are a fan then you will know that the enchanting, and often surreal locations for many of the backdrops in his movies are as integral to the film as, say, the plot, the distinctive fashion sense and the recurring use of his favourite actors such as Bill Murray (8 films), Owen Wilson (7 films) and Anjelica Huston (3 films), as examples. There are many, many scenes in Wes Anderson’s films where you think “I want to go there” and if Mark and I are watching one of his movies, it is not uncommon for us to pause it here and there whilst we figure out where the setting might be. The 2014 Grand Budapest Hotel is probably the movie in which we have done this the most. Who wouldn’t want to stay in the beguiling alpine resort in the fictional country of Zubrowka, in real life a defunct department store in Görlitz, Germany? Equally, Mendl’s cake shop, which also features prominently in the motion picture, is another irresistible location that actually is a functional bakery and dairy shop (Pfunds Dairy) in the east German city of Dresden. But, we also haven’t managed to watch either The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) or The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) without hitting the pause button and going off on a tangent to figure out some of the quirky places in which either of the movies were shot. And because we know the Indian city of Jodhpur and Udaipur fairly well, which is where The Darjeeling Limited (2007) was predominately filmed, it took us considerably longer than the 91-minutes running time to finish that particular movie. The Accidentally Wes Anderson book, which was published in October 2020, doesn’t focus on actual locations used in any of the films. Rather, it’s a collection of places and scenes that potentially tick all the right boxes to be featured in a Wes Anderson screenplay. Places that are visually striking, hark back to a bygone era, and are abstract and eccentric, for example, are all good starting points. Colour, particularly pastels, also play an important role in defining a possible candidate for a Wes Anderson film set, as does symmetry, dreamlike and darn right weirdness. Sunshine and lots of blue sky are also considerations. More importantly, they are images that we think fit the criteria for the growing movement of . The book’s introduction begins with the words “YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT”. If you travel and you are into Wes Anderson’s movies then this statement hits the spot perfectly. We’ve certainly seen buildings and the like and thought they would be good backdrops for a film by Wes Anderson, and we aren’t alone. The accidentallywesanderson Instagram account, by the same author, and the phenomena behind the book, has 1.3 million-plus followers and the hashtag, where anyone can post their photos, features more than 183,000 posts. And the whole Accidentally Wes Anderson theme is endorsed by the film director himself. There are some really stunning images in the book (plus great descriptions) and I would urge anyone interested in Wes Anderson’s movies to purchase a copy. My only gripe is that, at the moment, it is a rather sadistic publication to be thumbing through given there are very few/zero-travel opportunities on the foreseeable horizon! Keeping in mind the above criteria, what follows is our (more modest) collections of locations that we think ‘accidentally’ capture the essence of a scene for a Wes Anderson movie. Our explanations are brief – as the saying goes, “YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT” … And finally, during the course of putting this post together, I have worked out what our ideal job would be.

Although shop-bought pesto can be an easy substitute if time is of the essence 🙂 Homemade is always best! Enjoy! PS. It’s also totally detox approved! Ingredients: For pesto • 4 cups of basil leaves (about 140g basil) • 1/3 cup lightly toasted macadamia nuts (in dry pan) • 1 clove garlic • 3-4 TBS extra virgin olive oil • 2 TBS lemon juice (can also add 1 tsp lemon zest) • 1 tsp herb salt For pasta • Happy Earth People Pasta eg: Chickpea Pasta • Green veg (organic if possible) eg: broccoli (tender-stem is best), peas, baby spinach, baby marrows, kale Optional topping: • Vegan parmesan • Black pepper • Chopped toasted nuts/seeds Method: 1. Place all pesto ingredients in a food processor or high speed blender (eg: Nutrilbullet) and blend until smooth. Add more olive oil if you’d pref er a thinner consistency. 2. Lightly stem green veg until slightly soft (don’t overdue it as the veg will become “mushy”) 3. Cook pasta according to instructions. 4. To serve: mix steamed veg and some of the pesto into the pasta. Spoon into bowls and top with desired toppings. Notes: – For the pesto, you can also play around with different flavours eg: spinach, kale, rocket, coriander, or a combination – Leftover homemade pesto can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week About the author: After struggling with various health ailments for many years (including IBS, hormonal and skin problems and constant fatigue), I realised that there was no “quick fix”, and I was not willing to follow the conventional route of medication and “popping pills” everyday.

Hosted by an international NGO named Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) under the UN ECOSOC, this interfaith dialogue based on the study on religious scriptures by religious leaders from Portugal, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, the United States, and Yemen was to examine the value and meaning of religion that has now been a major cause of conflict. The First Man Written in Each Religion According to Sikhism, the human being came to exist as a process of evolution. As there are several stages to become a man from non-human entities like animals, the significance of mankind is that man who has achieved higher incarnation, is in the continuation of evolution toward the ultimate goal. “Sikhism considers the creation of a man as the climax in the evolutionary process. In so many incarnations, you were a worm and insect. After a long time, meeting the Lord of the universe, the human body is fashioned. When a man reaches the highest goal of evolution, he must remain earth-conscious so as to transform this mundane world into a higher and spiritual mode of existence,” said Mr. Gurmeet Singh, Director of Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha Institute in India. Zoroastrianism says that Gayomart is the first human being on the earth and ruled over Iran. By the creation of God as a higher incarnation, the existence of Gayomart has the quality of complete goodness, free will, and purpose of life - “destroying evil.” “Gayomart (the Righteous or Blessed Man) is the Primal Man.

       "      <td>The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan is not a documentary account of the struggle of the people of Ryazan in 1237 against the enemy that invaded the principality. Among the participants in the battle many names are mentioned that are unknown in chronicle sources. Some of the princes who, according to the Tale, fought against Batu had already died by 1237 (for example, Vsevolod of Pronsk who died in 1208 and David of Murom who died in 1228) and Oleg the Red is said to have died in it (when in fact he was in captivity until 1252 and died in 1258). These deviations from historical fact suggest that the Tale was written some time after the actual event, when the real facts had undergone a certain epic generalisation in people’s minds. The epic generalisation of the work can also be seen in the fact that all the Ryazan princes who fought in the battle against Batu are joined together in a single gigantic host and called brothers in the Tale. At the same time we must not date the writing of the Tale too long after the event which it describes. It was probably written not later than the middle of the fourteenth century. This, Dmitry Likhachev writes, “is also suggested by the intensity of the sorrow at the events of Batu’s invasion, which has not yet been softened or diminished by time, and a number of characteristic details that could have been remembered only by the closest generations”.27 We are examining The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan together with thirteenth-century works dealing with the Mongol invasion because it reflects epic legends about Batu’s campaign against Ryazan, some of which may have been created shortly after 1237. The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan gives the impression of being an independent work, although in the Old Russian manuscript tradition it is part of a compilation consisting of texts about an icon of St Nicholas.

       "2  Recipe by Zarah Zanon This tasty dish is easy to make and is delicious served both hot or cold. Although shop-bought pesto can be an easy substitute if time is of the essence 🙂 Homemade is always best! Enjoy! PS. It’s also totally detox approved! Ingredients: For pesto • 4 cups of basil leaves (about 140g basil) • 1/3 cup lightly toasted macadamia nuts (in dry pan) • 1 clove garlic • 3-4 TBS extra virgin olive oil • 2 TBS lemon juice (can also add 1 tsp lemon zest) • 1 tsp herb salt For pasta • Happy Earth People Pasta eg: Chickpea Pasta • Green veg (organic if possible) eg: broccoli (tender-stem is best), peas, baby spinach, baby marrows, kale Optional topping: • Vegan parmesan • Black pepper • Chopped toasted nuts/seeds Method: 1. Place all pesto ingredients in a food processor or high speed blender (eg: Nutrilbullet) and blend until smooth. Add more olive oil if you’d pref er a thinner consistency. 2. Lightly stem green veg until slightly soft (don’t overdue it as the veg will become “mushy”) 3. Cook pasta according to instructions. 4. To serve: mix steamed veg and some of the pesto into the pasta. Spoon into bowls and top with desired toppings. Notes: – For the pesto, you can also play around with different flavours eg: spinach, kale, rocket, coriander, or a combination – Leftover homemade pesto can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week About the author: After struggling with various health ailments for many years (including IBS, hormonal and skin problems and constant fatigue), I realised that there was no “quick fix”, and I was not willing to follow the conventional route of medication and “popping pills” everyday. I know and believe that I have been created perfectly by my creator, who has designed my body in such a way to heal itself when given the right nutrition and tools.

       "3  World Religions Discuss the Nature of Life through the Beginning of Man Kathmandu–On June 15th, with the theme of “About the Beginning of Man”, “The 6th Inter-Continental World Alliance of Religions’ Peace Office Meeting” was held to discuss religious teachings on human life written in scriptures through YouTube by religious representatives from Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism. Hosted by an international NGO named Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) under the UN ECOSOC, this interfaith dialogue based on the study on religious scriptures by religious leaders from Portugal, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, the United States, and Yemen was to examine the value and meaning of religion that has now been a major cause of conflict.

As there are several stages to become a man from non-human entities like animals, the significance of mankind is that man who has achieved higher incarnation, is in the continuation of evolution toward the ultimate goal. “Sikhism considers the creation of a man as the climax in the evolutionary process. In so many incarnations, you were a worm and insect. After a long time, meeting the Lord of the universe, the human body is fashioned. When a man reaches the highest goal of evolution, he must remain earth-conscious so as to transform this mundane world into a higher and spiritual mode of existence,” said Mr. Gurmeet Singh, Director of Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha Institute in India. Zoroastrianism says that Gayomart is the first human being on the earth and ruled over Iran. By the creation of God as a higher incarnation, the existence of Gayomart has the quality of complete goodness, free will, and purpose of life - “destroying evil.” “Gayomart (the Righteous or Blessed Man) is the Primal Man. He is the first human being on earth and is also regarded as the first King of Iran...   \n",

       "5  The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan is not a documentary account of the struggle of the people of Ryazan in 1237 against the enemy that invaded the principality. Among the participants in the battle many names are mentioned that are unknown in chronicle sources. Some of the princes who, according to the Tale, fought against Batu had already died by 1237 (for example, Vsevolod of Pronsk who died in 1208 and David of Murom who died in 1228) and Oleg the Red is said to have died in it (when in fact he was in captivity until 1252 and died in 1258). These deviations from historical fact suggest that the Tale was written some time after the actual event, when the real facts had undergone a certain epic generalisation in people’s minds. The epic generalisation of the work can also be seen in the fact that all the Ryazan princes who fought in the battle against Batu are joined together in a single gigantic host and called brothers in the Tale. At the same time we must not date the writing of the Tale too long after the event which it describes. It was probably written not later than the middle of the fourteenth century. This, Dmitry Likhachev writes, “is also suggested by the intensity of the sorrow at the events of Batu’s invasion, which has not yet been softened or diminished by time, and a number of characteristic details that could have been remembered only by the closest generations”.27 We are examining The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan together with thirteenth-century works dealing with the Mongol invasion because it reflects epic legends about Batu’s campaign against Ryazan, some of which may have been created shortly after 1237. The Tale of Batu’s Capture of Ryazan gives the impression of being an independent work, although in the Old Russian manuscript tradition it is part of a compilation consisting of texts about an icon of St Nicholas. This icon was taken to the Ryazan lands from Korsun (Chersonesus),[1] the town in w...   \n",
       "6  12 Thanksgiving Fall Outfit Ideas! Who else is excited to eat all of the food and pass out early this Thursday?! I can't be alone there, can I?? So to be totally honest, I'm not really the 'dress up' type of girl on Thanksgiving if I'm at my own house, which I usually am. I don't usually wear my shoes around the house as is, so at home I usually will have on slippers or socks or something but I love still putting some thought into what I might wear that will still look presentable while also stretching comfortably and allowing me to get a food baby belly.

Although shop-bought pesto can be an easy substitute if time is of the essence 🙂 Homemade is always best! Enjoy! PS. It’s also totally detox approved! Ingredients: For pesto • 4 cups of basil leaves (about 140g basil) • 1/3 cup lightly toasted macadamia nuts (in dry pan) • 1 clove garlic • 3-4 TBS extra virgin olive oil • 2 TBS lemon juice (can also add 1 tsp lemon zest) • 1 tsp herb salt For pasta • Happy Earth People Pasta eg: Chickpea Pasta • Green veg (organic if possible) eg: broccoli (tender-stem is best), peas, baby spinach, baby marrows, kale Optional topping: • Vegan parmesan • Black pepper • Chopped toasted nuts/seeds Method: 1. Place all pesto ingredients in a food processor or high speed blender (eg: Nutrilbullet) and blend until smooth. Add more olive oil if you’d pref er a thinner consistency. 2. Lightly stem green veg until slightly soft (don’t overdue it as the veg will become “mushy”) 3. Cook pasta according to instructions. 4. To serve: mix steamed veg and some of the pesto into the pasta. Spoon into bowls and top with desired toppings. Notes: – For the pesto, you can also play around with different flavours eg: spinach, kale, rocket, coriander, or a combination – Leftover homemade pesto can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week About the author: After struggling with various health ailments for many years (including IBS, hormonal and skin problems and constant fatigue), I realised that there was no “quick fix”, and I was not willing to follow the conventional route of medication and “popping pills” everyday.

       "      <td>World Religions Discuss the Nature of Life through the Beginning of Man Kathmandu–On June 15th, with the theme of “About the Beginning of Man”, “The 6th Inter-Continental World Alliance of Religions’ Peace Office Meeting” was held to discuss religious teachings on human life written in scriptures through YouTube by religious representatives from Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism. Hosted by an international NGO named Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) under the UN ECOSOC, this interfaith dialogue based on the study on religious scriptures by religious leaders from Portugal, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, the United States, and Yemen was to examine the value and meaning of religion that has now been a major cause of conflict. The First Man Written in Each Religion According to Sikhism, the human being came to exist as a process of evolution. As there are several stages to become a man from non-human entities like animals, the significance of mankind is that man who has achieved higher incarnation, is in the continuation of evolution toward the ultimate goal. “Sikhism considers the creation of a man as the climax in the evolutionary process. In so many incarnations, you were a worm and insect. After a long time, meeting the Lord of the universe, the human body is fashioned. When a man reaches the highest goal of evolution, he must remain earth-conscious so as to transform this mundane world into a higher and spiritual mode of existence,” said Mr. Gurmeet Singh, Director of Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha Institute in India. Zoroastrianism says that Gayomart is the first human being on the earth and ruled over Iran. By the creation of God as a higher incarnation, the existence of Gayomart has the quality of complete goodness, free will, and purpose of life - “destroying evil.” “Gayomart (the Righteous or Blessed Man) is the Primal Man.

       "2  Recipe by Zarah Zanon This tasty dish is easy to make and is delicious served both hot or cold. Although shop-bought pesto can be an easy substitute if time is of the essence 🙂 Homemade is always best! Enjoy! PS. It’s also totally detox approved! Ingredients: For pesto • 4 cups of basil leaves (about 140g basil) • 1/3 cup lightly toasted macadamia nuts (in dry pan) • 1 clove garlic • 3-4 TBS extra virgin olive oil • 2 TBS lemon juice (can also add 1 tsp lemon zest) • 1 tsp herb salt For pasta • Happy Earth People Pasta eg: Chickpea Pasta • Green veg (organic if possible) eg: broccoli (tender-stem is best), peas, baby spinach, baby marrows, kale Optional topping: • Vegan parmesan • Black pepper • Chopped toasted nuts/seeds Method: 1. Place all pesto ingredients in a food processor or high speed blender (eg: Nutrilbullet) and blend until smooth. Add more olive oil if you’d pref er a thinner consistency. 2. Lightly stem green veg until slightly soft (don’t overdue it as the veg will become “mushy”) 3. Cook pasta according to instructions. 4. To serve: mix steamed veg and some of the pesto into the pasta. Spoon into bowls and top with desired toppings. Notes: – For the pesto, you can also play around with different flavours eg: spinach, kale, rocket, coriander, or a combination – Leftover homemade pesto can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week About the author: After struggling with various health ailments for many years (including IBS, hormonal and skin problems and constant fatigue), I realised that there was no “quick fix”, and I was not willing to follow the conventional route of medication and “popping pills” everyday. I know and believe that I have been created perfectly by my creator, who has designed my body in such a way to heal itself when given the right nutrition and tools.

       "3  World Religions Discuss the Nature of Life through the Beginning of Man Kathmandu–On June 15th, with the theme of “About the Beginning of Man”, “The 6th Inter-Continental World Alliance of Religions’ Peace Office Meeting” was held to discuss religious teachings on human life written in scriptures through YouTube by religious representatives from Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism. Hosted by an international NGO named Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) under the UN ECOSOC, this interfaith dialogue based on the study on religious scriptures by religious leaders from Portugal, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, the United States, and Yemen was to examine the value and meaning of religion that has now been a major cause of conflict. The First Man Written in Each Religion According to Sikhism, the human being came to exist as a process of evolution. As there are several stages to become a man from non-human entities like animals, the significance of mankind is that man who has achieved higher incarnation, is in the continuation of evolution toward the ultimate goal. “Sikhism considers the creation of a man as the climax in the evolutionary process. In so many incarnations, you were a worm and insect. After a long time, meeting the Lord of the universe, the human body is fashioned. When a man reaches the highest goal of evolution, he must remain earth-conscious so as to transform this mundane world into a higher and spiritual mode of existence,” said Mr. Gurmeet Singh, Director of Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha Institute in India. Zoroastrianism says that Gayomart is the first human being on the earth and ruled over Iran. By the creation of God as a higher incarnation, the existence of Gayomart has the quality of complete goodness, free will, and purpose of life - “destroying evil.” “Gayomart (the Righteous or Blessed Man) is the Primal Man. He is the first human being on earth and is also regarded as the first King of Iran...   \n",

I remember when I never wore anything of the sort. Only neutral I said and then one day the spirit hit me. What I love about this print trend is that it’s not traditional prints like stripes and polka dot. It’s obscure, abstract prints, artist like brush strokes and odd patterns and shapes. I’m really into these funky vibes. I recently stepped into an H&amp;M store and my mind was a little blown. I’m so used to shopping online that I forgot the feeling of instantly falling in love with apiece and getting to take it home that day. H&amp;M’s collection only keeps getting better year after year. Let’s just say I’m semi to very obsessed. Be sure to shop the H&amp;M Studio AW’17 collection on September 14th! 1 Comment Killing it with the braids girl!</td>\n",

Except the moment I have to take myself oh so seriously, I can't. I ultimately end up scrolling through hundreds of \"outfit of the day\" photographs I make my husband take, miserably shouting that he either sucks at taking photographs or I am horribly un-photogenic. So let's not take ourselves seriously. Let's take crappy Iphone photos, throw in some strollers, little baby's feet, clutter, and maybe even the occasional spit stain.

       "      <td>Fitz Fashion Fix for Autumn, Autumn/Winter Trends from Victoria Square!Thursday, September 19, 2013 The Fitzwilliam hotel recently hosted an exclusive evening to celebrate fashion at its finest and beauty at its best by offering guests a sneak peak at Victoria Square’s upcoming Autumn/Winter collections from The Square. I was lucky enough to be there for NI Gossip Guy to report on all the latest upcoming trends! Smirnoff cocktails, Peroni and light bites were enjoyed by guests in the awarding winning Fitzwilliam bar while Rebecca and her team of experts previewed their collections. We enjoyed a chic catwalk show, compared by Victoria Square’s personal stylist Rebecca McKinney, with models showcasing her stylish trend predictions suitable for every fashionista’s wish list. As a regular shopper in Victoria Square I love it's mix of high end and high street brands and so was very much looking forward to see which trends she was rating and how she would style them! Top of Rebecca's Autumn/Winter hit list of trends were graphic prints, worn top to toe for maximum impact, or incorporated through handbags or shoes, showing there is a way to wear prints that will suit everyone. Leather was also key, from dressed down glamour in leather look leggings to sophisticated leather pencil skirts, this is a trend that's set to stay! I've been a big fan of the lateher trend fo a while now and seriously loved the leather look leggings, a total bargain from H&amp;M! Colour featured heavily, simple silhouettes given an injection of colour, with hues of red and cobalt blues, while masculine tailoring gave dressed up looks a relaxed feel. Menswear saw the heritage trend continuing, with sharp tailoring contrasting perfectly with countryside tweeds, creating a perfect dressed down look. While separates like waistcoats can be styled in various ways to create a multitude of looks! With lots of exciting new trends, guests couldn't wait to hit the stores in Victoria Square to shop the new piec...</td>\n",

       "      <td>Locally Richmond: Fairy wing maker goes national on February 26, 2016on February 26, 2016 Locally Richmond is an occasional series of profiles that highlights the small businesses that contribute to making Richmond a unique community. When does an artist know she has reached a milestone in her career? For Angela Jarman, she knew the minute her work was worn by models strutting down the catwalk of Victoria’s Secret fashion shows. Jarman makes fairy wings—small or big, as intricate or as simple as the client requests—and she is making a name for herself and her niche. “I’ve been drawing since I was in third and fourth grade,” says Jarman, a Richmond artist. “I was always interested in the fantasy genre, and for a long while unicorns were my main subject matter and that is mostly all that I drew.” Soon after high school, Jarman decided to get into graphic art and design because her father told her it would be a more lucrative career, and easier to find work, than simply drawing pictures, which was “mostly true,” says Jarman. In addition to being a graphic designer in the Bay Area, Jarman worked part-time at children’s parties doing face painting and dressing up as a princess or fairy. Before long, Jarman was itching to make her own costume to wear at the events she was attending. “I really wanted an original fairy costume, and my favorite movies that inspired the look were The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. In each movie there were these iridescent and insect-like fairy wings, instead of the glittery and pink fluffy wings,” says Jarman. wings would sell—when she posted an ad online, they sold almost immediately. Around 2003, she chose to make “fairy wing maker” her full time profession, and launched her own company, “Fancy Fairy Wings and Things!” Jarman continued to work at parties as well as working for a Halloween company until about 2013, before fully relying on wing making to support her financially. Jarman works from her home, where her studio is colorfully deco...</td>\n",

To this day, that is all I want on my birthday. I need to feel special on my birthday and that is my confession. There I said it. Ahh, the relief! I am so overwhelmed by the amount of birthday greetings I read the day after my birthday on Facebook! You, my Facebook friends, ROCK! I away appreciate the text messages, cards, phone calls, voice mails and gifts even more! I do have to say my favorite was my brother’s clan all (wife and 3 kids) singing Happy Birthday to me on a voice mail. I spent my birthday sightseeing in Manhattan with Jim, since we had not done it yet. I had a great time, yet at times I did not conquer feeling like a Big Birthday Fish in the Huge Ocean of Manhattan. It is all about choices one makes…you can make it happen or not. And next time…I will make it happen all live long birth-day! With this all said here is a sample of my Man-Birth-Hattan-Day! (Click on photos for full album) Okay, it did not start in Manhattan, the night before we hit this cool spot in our temporary hood of Park Slope South, Sidecar – Cures All Pain. Sidecar has cool cocktails and gourmet comfort food to boot. My birthday started out with it being a winter wonderland outside and some pancakes! Once we took some snow photos, we went straight to Time Square. Then we had some lunch off of Madison Ave at Cinema on our way to Rockefeller Center. Ha, on the way we hit Bryant Park, the mecca for fashion shows. The best park bathrooms ever! On our journey we kept on stepping into this store and that store to find me a fun winter hat! Loft did not have any, J Crew did not have any, Benetton did not have any, and even H&amp;M did not have any (but I did get a cute light pink scarf for $5.00 there). Oh well! But low and behold when we got back to Times Square to get on the long line for cheap Broadway show tickets, I found thi...</td>\n",

Make sure to tune in over here on Monday the 17th at 4pm London time. Enjoy!BURBERRY LIVESTREAM edgy skirts – ah, those skirts! The only thing that did not have to happen in my eye, was the fringed shoes.DIESEL BLACK GOLD here, but I have to organize everything first. Unpack, repack for my holiday to the USA… I was wearing a blazer and leather shorts from H&amp;M, clutch from Minusey, a barely there necklace from Luv Aj and J.W. Anderson shoes. ph/ Anna NooshinTO 3.1 PHILLIP LIM ph/ Tess van Daelen3.1 PHILLIP LIM As quoted on the program note of Diane von Furstenberg: “Some fairy tales end with the girl marrying the prince… some start there.” That sentence led to a very colorful – very DvF – collection, with caftans kind of replacing her famous wrap dresses. The coolest looks were those that showed dresses worn over trousers, which looked super chic in these vibrant colors and luxe fabrics.DIANE VON FURSTENBERG</td>\n",

       "      <td>Good weather calls for nothing else than a flimsy white summer dress, a colourful detail and some loose curls. It’s been raining non-stop the past days, but everything looks bright and beautiful for the upcoming days. Hello BBQ’s, garden parties and late night ramblings around the bonfire. It’s the first day of July, which also equals the start of the summer sales in Belgian. It just so happens that I’m on my way to Antwerp as we speak – but I promise I won’t do a lot of shopping damage as I have a full day of meetings ahead. In any case, the future is bright! Check out the Flair website today for details about this look and why this is my favourite summer getup. I’m wearing an ASOS Petite white chiffon dress (shop here), yellow bag from H&amp;M and Geox heeled sandals. Pics by Cédric.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Every time i go out it's the same. I have a better time than the previous one. This town is crazy. It is occupied by lunatics. And i am the biggest one of them. I am picking off from my last post, which was when i was about to meet Fabian @ 6:30 to visit the Systembolaget (only place where you can buy booze). I get in the center 6:30 sharp and i see even more weirdly dressed people climbing the lamps in the middle of the street. Smile for the camera! Right out of the H&amp;M magazine people dressed as witches, kings, queens, archers, goblins. I approached them sneakily. \"Can you give me a good smile for my blog?\" \"Sure, if you give us 10 crowns!\" \"Whhhhat? What for?\" \"We are in a competition!\" \"Ok but you have to give me a really great smile!\" They cheer like they won the lottery and get together in a semi-circle, singing something i have no idea or recollection of. I take two photos and i wink at the sexy lady in the grey dress. Oh i actually gave them 20 crowns. I turn around and Fabian is staring at me. Haha. We greet and we gps our way to the closest alcohol shop. I buy 3 Newcastle beers, he gets 4 and i have some fun eyeballing the swedish blonde staring at me on the next counter. I pay 47 crowns for the beers and 1 crown for the bag. Eco-friendly. We get his bike and move to the local ICA to get some food for our hosts. Chips and a nice dip sauce, hand made by Fabian. He gets his bike, texts me the location of the Flogsta party and i m on my way to the bus. Number 2. I greet Jose in a beer shop and i reach the bus stop where i find sam and stephanie, which is a relief because i have no clue where to stop. Weird super-cool asian guy from canada studying pharmacy talks to us. His voice is not very manly, but he has loads of humor. Good luck with your studies man. We stop at the Flogsta ICA and we head towards Evelina's apartment. The building number sequence does not make sense. The door is unlocked. We get in. The apartment door is unlocked. We get in.

According to fashion week, prints are still going strong and I don’t know if it’s the energy in the air but I’m still loving a good print. I remember when I never wore anything of the sort. Only neutral I said and then one day the spirit hit me. What I love about this print trend is that it’s not traditional prints like stripes and polka dot. It’s obscure, abstract prints, artist like brush strokes and odd patterns and shapes. I’m really into these funky vibes. I recently stepped into an H&M store and my mind was a little blown. I’m so used to shopping online that I forgot the feeling of instantly falling in love with apiece and getting to take it home that day. H&M’s collection only keeps getting better year after year. Let’s just say I’m semi to very obsessed. Be sure to shop the H&M Studio AW’17 collection on September 14th! 1 Comment Killing it with the braids girl!   \n",

Lately I have been very much into documenting outfits. I kind of want to make this a thing. Except the moment I have to take myself oh so seriously, I can't. I ultimately end up scrolling through hundreds of \"outfit of the day\" photographs I make my husband take, miserably shouting that he either sucks at taking photographs or I am horribly un-photogenic. So let's not take ourselves seriously. Let's take crappy Iphone photos, throw in some strollers, little baby's feet, clutter, and maybe even the occasional spit stain.

       "31  Fitz Fashion Fix for Autumn, Autumn/Winter Trends from Victoria Square!Thursday, September 19, 2013 The Fitzwilliam hotel recently hosted an exclusive evening to celebrate fashion at its finest and beauty at its best by offering guests a sneak peak at Victoria Square’s upcoming Autumn/Winter collections from The Square. I was lucky enough to be there for NI Gossip Guy to report on all the latest upcoming trends! Smirnoff cocktails, Peroni and light bites were enjoyed by guests in the awarding winning Fitzwilliam bar while Rebecca and her team of experts previewed their collections. We enjoyed a chic catwalk show, compared by Victoria Square’s personal stylist Rebecca McKinney, with models showcasing her stylish trend predictions suitable for every fashionista’s wish list. As a regular shopper in Victoria Square I love it's mix of high end and high street brands and so was very much looking forward to see which trends she was rating and how she would style them! Top of Rebecca's Autumn/Winter hit list of trends were graphic prints, worn top to toe for maximum impact, or incorporated through handbags or shoes, showing there is a way to wear prints that will suit everyone. Leather was also key, from dressed down glamour in leather look leggings to sophisticated leather pencil skirts, this is a trend that's set to stay! I've been a big fan of the lateher trend fo a while now and seriously loved the leather look leggings, a total bargain from H&M! Colour featured heavily, simple silhouettes given an injection of colour, with hues of red and cobalt blues, while masculine tailoring gave dressed up looks a relaxed feel. Menswear saw the heritage trend continuing, with sharp tailoring contrasting perfectly with countryside tweeds, creating a perfect dressed down look. While separates like waistcoats can be styled in various ways to create a multitude of looks! With lots of exciting new trends, guests couldn't wait to hit the stores in Victoria Square to shop the new piec...   \n",
       "37  Locally Richmond: Fairy wing maker goes national on February 26, 2016on February 26, 2016 Locally Richmond is an occasional series of profiles that highlights the small businesses that contribute to making Richmond a unique community. When does an artist know she has reached a milestone in her career? For Angela Jarman, she knew the minute her work was worn by models strutting down the catwalk of Victoria’s Secret fashion shows. Jarman makes fairy wings—small or big, as intricate or as simple as the client requests—and she is making a name for herself and her niche. “I’ve been drawing since I was in third and fourth grade,” says Jarman, a Richmond artist. “I was always interested in the fantasy genre, and for a long while unicorns were my main subject matter and that is mostly all that I drew.” Soon after high school, Jarman decided to get into graphic art and design because her father told her it would be a more lucrative career, and easier to find work, than simply drawing pictures, which was “mostly true,” says Jarman. In addition to being a graphic designer in the Bay Area, Jarman worked part-time at children’s parties doing face painting and dressing up as a princess or fairy. Before long, Jarman was itching to make her own costume to wear at the events she was attending. “I really wanted an original fairy costume, and my favorite movies that inspired the look were The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. In each movie there were these iridescent and insect-like fairy wings, instead of the glittery and pink fluffy wings,” says Jarman. wings would sell—when she posted an ad online, they sold almost immediately. Around 2003, she chose to make “fairy wing maker” her full time profession, and launched her own company, “Fancy Fairy Wings and Things!” Jarman continued to work at parties as well as working for a Halloween company until about 2013, before fully relying on wing making to support her financially. Jarman works from her home, where her studio is colorfully deco...   \n",

       "39  CONFESSIONS OF A 46TH BIRTHDAY I blame it on my Mom. Widowed single woman with 5 kids and she still seemed to make each one of us feel special on our birthdays. To this day, that is all I want on my birthday. I need to feel special on my birthday and that is my confession. There I said it. Ahh, the relief! I am so overwhelmed by the amount of birthday greetings I read the day after my birthday on Facebook! You, my Facebook friends, ROCK! I away appreciate the text messages, cards, phone calls, voice mails and gifts even more! I do have to say my favorite was my brother’s clan all (wife and 3 kids) singing Happy Birthday to me on a voice mail. I spent my birthday sightseeing in Manhattan with Jim, since we had not done it yet. I had a great time, yet at times I did not conquer feeling like a Big Birthday Fish in the Huge Ocean of Manhattan. It is all about choices one makes…you can make it happen or not. And next time…I will make it happen all live long birth-day! With this all said here is a sample of my Man-Birth-Hattan-Day! (Click on photos for full album) Okay, it did not start in Manhattan, the night before we hit this cool spot in our temporary hood of Park Slope South, Sidecar – Cures All Pain. Sidecar has cool cocktails and gourmet comfort food to boot. My birthday started out with it being a winter wonderland outside and some pancakes! Once we took some snow photos, we went straight to Time Square. Then we had some lunch off of Madison Ave at Cinema on our way to Rockefeller Center. Ha, on the way we hit Bryant Park, the mecca for fashion shows. The best park bathrooms ever! On our journey we kept on stepping into this store and that store to find me a fun winter hat! Loft did not have any, J Crew did not have any, Benetton did not have any, and even H&M did not have any (but I did get a cute light pink scarf for $5.00 there). Oh well! But low and behold when we got back to Times Square to get on the long line for cheap Broadway show tickets, I found thi...   \n",

It’s the first day of July, which also equals the start of the summer sales in Belgian. It just so happens that I’m on my way to Antwerp as we speak – but I promise I won’t do a lot of shopping damage as I have a full day of meetings ahead. In any case, the future is bright!

       "45  Every time i go out it's the same. I have a better time than the previous one. This town is crazy. It is occupied by lunatics. And i am the biggest one of them. I am picking off from my last post, which was when i was about to meet Fabian @ 6:30 to visit the Systembolaget (only place where you can buy booze). I get in the center 6:30 sharp and i see even more weirdly dressed people climbing the lamps in the middle of the street. Smile for the camera! Right out of the H&M magazine people dressed as witches, kings, queens, archers, goblins. I approached them sneakily. \"Can you give me a good smile for my blog?\" \"Sure, if you give us 10 crowns!\" \"Whhhhat? What for?\" \"We are in a competition!\" \"Ok but you have to give me a really great smile!\" They cheer like they won the lottery and get together in a semi-circle, singing something i have no idea or recollection of. I take two photos and i wink at the sexy lady in the grey dress. Oh i actually gave them 20 crowns. I turn around and Fabian is staring at me. Haha. We greet and we gps our way to the closest alcohol shop. I buy 3 Newcastle beers, he gets 4 and i have some fun eyeballing the swedish blonde staring at me on the next counter. I pay 47 crowns for the beers and 1 crown for the bag. Eco-friendly. We get his bike and move to the local ICA to get some food for our hosts. Chips and a nice dip sauce, hand made by Fabian. He gets his bike, texts me the location of the Flogsta party and i m on my way to the bus. Number 2. I greet Jose in a beer shop and i reach the bus stop where i find sam and stephanie, which is a relief because i have no clue where to stop. Weird super-cool asian guy from canada studying pharmacy talks to us. His voice is not very manly, but he has loads of humor. Good luck with your studies man. We stop at the Flogsta ICA and we head towards Evelina's apartment. The building number sequence does not make sense. The door is unlocked. We get in. The apartment door is unlocked. We get in. Try that...   \n",

Now I know I ain’t “Gangster”, and as just a geeky little white girl to even attempt to rap along to these lyrics (yes, that’s right, I have a go), will not help me be cool no matter how hard I try, but I will say that I absolutely love this song!!! What a tune, I mean, how can a song still be this good even when half of the lyrics are beeped out (I had to be very careful with my selection of lyric, so I figured I would just go for the first line as this appeared to be the safest option). So yup, I really do love this song, it’s amazing! You can watch the video here (but only if you’re not easily offended by the colourful lyrics), and you can visit her website here. Right, lets crack on... Blazer: River Island (old) Shirt: River Island (sale, £15.00) Jeans: Primark (old) Shoes: Matalan (£6.00) Bag: Primark (old) Bowler Hat: H&amp;M (£12.99) I bought this shirt the other day when I was having a little browse at the River Island sale online and I am so glad I found it! Who doesn't love Tartan?!?! (people who don't love tartan thats who), but luckily enough I blinkin' love it, that's why I bought it duh! Anywho, I knew that this shirt would go lovely with my recently purchased bargain shoes in Matalan, they only cost me six whole pounds! That's six pounds!! God bless you Matalan you lovely lovely people!! Add my over used old blazer, slip myself into a pair of extremely snug fitting Primark jeans and stick a bowler hat on top and bish bash bosh job done! Stay sexy,</td>\n",

That feeling when you find the perfect location for outfit photos and you feel like all your worldly worries are made okay. Not gonna lie, I'm still on a high from that feeling a good 72 hours after taking these pics. I love how washed out and bright this building is. Here's an advanced warning that my next few outfits will be coming from this location! On another note - there are three things I need to get off my chest. (None of them important at all, don't worry.) The first is that this weather in England is crazy and it's really getting on my nerves, man. It's nearly May and we had hail today? Like ice fell from the sky. In April. ??? Secondly, I'm really loving Childish Gambino's music again at the minute. My flatmates and I watched Magic Mike XXL last weekend and I forgot that Donald Glover was in it and how gorgeous he is in general. Sweatpants has been my jam in the gym this week. For some reason it's got the perfect beat when you're on the rowing machine? Finally, is it possible to be so in love with a simple v neck tee? I picked it up for £5 in Primark and it's my new favourite / most simple thing in my wardrobe. But it's so soft and slouchy and the stripes are so thin and delicate that I can't help but want to wear it 7 days a week. But anyway, what's new with you guys? I've been so out of the loop with blogging this month so I hope April has been treating you well! x Finding a good photo spot is like gold! You look awesome. Amy Ann Straight A Style This is super cute Ruby! I love your jacket x holljc.blogspot.co.uk I am obsessed with this bomber jacket - you look gorgeous! xx This cardigan looks so pretty on you.

       "      <td>PRIMARK has opened its doors in Coventry city centre but for many people, the store in Broadgate will always be remembered as the home of Owen Owen. Today, former workers at the old department store recall their time on Owen's shop floor. THERE was a definite feel of \"Are You Being Served?\" about Coventry's old Owen Owen store which sold everything from high fashion to hardware and haberdashery for more than 50 years. The television sit-com from the 1970s had more than a few echoes of life in the four-floor department store owned by Duncan Norman and his son \"Mr John.\" And yes, there had originally been a Mr Owen Owen - he was a Welshman whose daughter had married into the Norman family from Liverpool. Despite being part of a small chain, local people became fond of the up-market store. Not least because the first Owen Owen, on the corner of the Burges and Trinity Street, had been bombed along with the rest of the city centre during the 1940 Coventry Blitz. That first shop - part of which still stands today - offered housewives of the 1930s the unique opportunity of buying everything they wanted all under one roof. Back in 1937 that was a whole new shopping experience. But not one destined to last. The store had only been open for two years when the Second World War started in 1939. A year later, just like the old Cathedral nearby, it became an empty smoking shell with outside walls intact, but the roof blasted away. The replacement store, which officially opened amid huge excitement on October 1, 1954, was just a few yards up the road, in Broadgate. The new manager was a woman, a Miss Pinnock, who presided over 400 staff working in 100 departments from the basement brooms and buckets to the glories of jewellery, perfume, bedding and baby linen. Then there were the 12 assistants just to serve ladies stockings!, now aged 83 and living with his wife Barbara in Faircroft Road, Kenilworth, said: \"I still remember my first sale was a reel of red Sylko cotton that cos...</td>\n",

Why 'Loo-sley Crafting' - a very clever amalgamation of Lucy and Lesley (her and me) - impressed? Good.!! Before Christmas we were both sewing like mad things making all manner of things for school fairs, orders and gifts. Once all that was done and dusted we started discussing ways to help keep up the creativity in the New Year.!! In a very roundabout way that has led us to set up another blog to record our progress. Our first Challenge, this week, happened entirely by coincidence when we realised we'd both made the sock monkeys we'd been wanting to make for ages - on the same day and at the same time! Spooky! Mrs Locket produced the gorgeous Freddy using the best Primarni (Primark) socks: Whilst I churned out Minnie Mabel and Peter Parker again using quality sockage - this time courtesy of Peacocks: The pattern for these guys was obtained by following this link on the marvellous Monkee Maker's blog. Be ready with a goodly amount of stuffing if you plan to make one - and do at least double stitching on all the seams to avoid embarassing inner thigh burstage - on the monkey!?!!) Watch this space..... If you want to join in and send us your pictures then please feel free. Here's to a Crafty New Year! love Lucy Locket and Moogsmum xxx 22 comments: Congratulations you two on the birth of your new blog! Gosh... even more to read now! Good luck with your challenges. Ginaxxx You Go Girls! Looks like lots of fun! Do you two ever sleep!!! Oh you girls, you're too funny. Looking forward to popping in! Good luck with the challenges girls!

She hasn't done it in a while to be fair, she has two little cellular blankets that she likes to cuddle. But when she has insisted on holding a book for her nap she wakes up and sits there \"reading\" 🤣 I'll just hear her chatting away to herself over the monitor haha Pic of her the last time she insisted on holding a book to sleep - We bought my eldest some peppa pig armbands on holiday one year and she loved them so much she went to sleep holding one of them for months after we got home 🤣 - Posted 1/16/21My girl tires to shove her finger in my bellybutton when feeding and I hate it 😔 she loves to chose a nice sock to cuddle, which I think is so sweet.

Now I know I ain’t “Gangster”, and as just a geeky little white girl to even attempt to rap along to these lyrics (yes, that’s right, I have a go), will not help me be cool no matter how hard I try, but I will say that I absolutely love this song!!! What a tune, I mean, how can a song still be this good even when half of the lyrics are beeped out (I had to be very careful with my selection of lyric, so I figured I would just go for the first line as this appeared to be the safest option). So yup, I really do love this song, it’s amazing! You can watch the video here (but only if you’re not easily offended by the colourful lyrics), and you can visit her website here. Right, lets crack on... Blazer: River Island (old) Shirt: River Island (sale, £15.00) Jeans: Primark (old) Shoes: Matalan (£6.00) Bag: Primark (old) Bowler Hat: H&M (£12.99) I bought this shirt the other day when I was having a little browse at the River Island sale online and I am so glad I found it! Who doesn't love Tartan?!?! (people who don't love tartan thats who), but luckily enough I blinkin' love it, that's why I bought it duh! Anywho, I knew that this shirt would go lovely with my recently purchased bargain shoes in Matalan, they only cost me six whole pounds! That's six pounds!! God bless you Matalan you lovely lovely people!! Add my over used old blazer, slip myself into a pair of extremely snug fitting Primark jeans and stick a bowler hat on top and bish bash bosh job done! Stay sexy,   \n",
       "51   Bomber Jacket, Jeans - Topshop // Tee, Cardi - Primark // Watch - Olivia Burton Guys. That feeling when you find the perfect location for outfit photos and you feel like all your worldly worries are made okay. Not gonna lie, I'm still on a high from that feeling a good 72 hours after taking these pics. I love how washed out and bright this building is. Here's an advanced warning that my next few outfits will be coming from this location! On another note - there are three things I need to get off my chest. (None of them important at all, don't worry.) The first is that this weather in England is crazy and it's really getting on my nerves, man. It's nearly May and we had hail today? Like ice fell from the sky. In April. ??? Secondly, I'm really loving Childish Gambino's music again at the minute. My flatmates and I watched Magic Mike XXL last weekend and I forgot that Donald Glover was in it and how gorgeous he is in general. Sweatpants has been my jam in the gym this week. For some reason it's got the perfect beat when you're on the rowing machine? Finally, is it possible to be so in love with a simple v neck tee? I picked it up for £5 in Primark and it's my new favourite / most simple thing in my wardrobe. But it's so soft and slouchy and the stripes are so thin and delicate that I can't help but want to wear it 7 days a week. But anyway, what's new with you guys? I've been so out of the loop with blogging this month so I hope April has been treating you well! x Finding a good photo spot is like gold! You look awesome. Amy Ann Straight A Style This is super cute Ruby! I love your jacket x holljc.blogspot.co.uk I am obsessed with this bomber jacket - you look gorgeous! xx This cardigan looks so pretty on you.

       "52   PRIMARK has opened its doors in Coventry city centre but for many people, the store in Broadgate will always be remembered as the home of Owen Owen. Today, former workers at the old department store recall their time on Owen's shop floor. THERE was a definite feel of \"Are You Being Served?\" about Coventry's old Owen Owen store which sold everything from high fashion to hardware and haberdashery for more than 50 years. The television sit-com from the 1970s had more than a few echoes of life in the four-floor department store owned by Duncan Norman and his son \"Mr John.\" And yes, there had originally been a Mr Owen Owen - he was a Welshman whose daughter had married into the Norman family from Liverpool. Despite being part of a small chain, local people became fond of the up-market store. Not least because the first Owen Owen, on the corner of the Burges and Trinity Street, had been bombed along with the rest of the city centre during the 1940 Coventry Blitz. That first shop - part of which still stands today - offered housewives of the 1930s the unique opportunity of buying everything they wanted all under one roof. Back in 1937 that was a whole new shopping experience. But not one destined to last. The store had only been open for two years when the Second World War started in 1939. A year later, just like the old Cathedral nearby, it became an empty smoking shell with outside walls intact, but the roof blasted away. The replacement store, which officially opened amid huge excitement on October 1, 1954, was just a few yards up the road, in Broadgate.

       "96   Hello there crafty people and welcome to a new joint venture between Lucy Locket and Moogsmum !! Here's a little background to help explain what on earth is going on! Why 'Loo-sley Crafting' - a very clever amalgamation of Lucy and Lesley (her and me) - impressed? Good.!! Before Christmas we were both sewing like mad things making all manner of things for school fairs, orders and gifts. Once all that was done and dusted we started discussing ways to help keep up the creativity in the New Year.!! In a very roundabout way that has led us to set up another blog to record our progress. Our first Challenge, this week, happened entirely by coincidence when we realised we'd both made the sock monkeys we'd been wanting to make for ages - on the same day and at the same time! Spooky! Mrs Locket produced the gorgeous Freddy using the best Primarni (Primark) socks: Whilst I churned out Minnie Mabel and Peter Parker again using quality sockage - this time courtesy of Peacocks: The pattern for these guys was obtained by following this link on the marvellous Monkee Maker's blog. Be ready with a goodly amount of stuffing if you plan to make one - and do at least double stitching on all the seams to avoid embarassing inner thigh burstage - on the monkey!?!!) Watch this space..... If you want to join in and send us your pictures then please feel free. Here's to a Crafty New Year! love Lucy Locket and Moogsmum xxx 22 comments: Congratulations you two on the birth of your new blog! Gosh... even more to read now! Good luck with your challenges. Ginaxxx You Go Girls! Looks like lots of fun! Do you two ever sleep!!! Oh you girls, you're too funny. Looking forward to popping in! Good luck with the challenges girls! I'm impressed with your energies! A great way to start the new year. Dear Moosley, Y'all are so clever and fantastic and I shall watch with great interest. Just off now to put this blog addy into my quick read file. I'll be back! (Can you tell 'Terminator' is on while Itype...   \n",

My belly button...not even joking, every night since stopping breastfeeding, he's fallen asleep with his finger in my belly button 😂😂 any other little weirdos out there with odd comforters or obsessions?! Original poster's comments (3) - Photo of my funny onion just because he's so darn cute! - Posted 1/16/21Mine sleeps with a sleepsuit in her hand. Nothing else works. It is the poppers on them and I think she likes hoe she can stretch the legs and arms. So wierd. She isn't bothered which one etc. I can give her a new one everyday at least. I have tried finding blankets with poppers on but nope. She wants to hold a sleepsuit to sleep. She puts the poppers in her eyes whilst she goes to sleep 🤷♀️🤷♀️🤷♀️🤷♀️🤣See all replies (1) - SarahMichelle87 said:Mine sleeps with a sleepsuit in her hand. Nothing else works. It is th…Oh that's adorable 😂😍 - Posted 1/16/21Hehe that's so funny 🤣 bless him! My little girl is obsessed with books and quite often at nap time she likes to go to sleep holding one. She hasn't done it in a while to be fair, she has two little cellular blankets that she likes to cuddle. But when she has insisted on holding a book for her nap she wakes up and sits there \"reading\" 🤣 I'll just hear her chatting away to herself over the monitor haha Pic of her the last time she insisted on holding a book to sleep - We bought my eldest some peppa pig armbands on holiday one year and she loved them so much she went to sleep holding one of them for months after we got home 🤣 - Posted 1/16/21My girl tires to shove her finger in my bellybutton when feeding and I hate it 😔 she loves to chose a nice sock to cuddle, which I think is so sweet. I have an album on Instagram called Sock Diaries which is just pics of her cuddling her sock of the day. So cute. - These are all adorable! 😍 my little one doesn't have a comforter but these are such cute exampl...   \n",

    "### VADER Sentiment Analysis Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a sentiment analysis method that combines rule-based logic with a specialized lexicon to evaluate the sentiment of textual data. Originally developed for use with social media language, it is now widely adopted across various domains like product reviews and short informal texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Characteristics of VADER\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Based on a Sentiment Lexicon**: VADER uses a dictionary of words manually rated for their emotional tone by humans. Each entry is assigned a sentiment score.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Polarity and Strength Recognition**: Words are not only labeled as positive, neutral, or negative, but are also given scores indicating how intense the emotion is, ranging between -4 (strongly negative) and +4 (strongly positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Score Normalization**: The overall sentiment for a sentence is computed and then scaled to a value between -1 and +1, where -1 indicates extreme negativity and +1 indicates strong positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Sensitivity**: VADER includes rules that adjust scores based on contextual clues such as:\n",
    "  - Modifiers like “extremely” or “barely”\n",
    "  - The sequence and arrangement of words\n",
    "  - Use of exclamation marks or all caps (e.g., \"AMAZING!\")\n",
    "  - Emoticons (e.g., \":)\"), internet slang (\"LOL\"), or casual speech (\"meh\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How VADER Analyzes Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The process involves:\n",
    "1. Identifying sentiment-bearing words from the lexicon.\n",
    "2. Tweaking those scores depending on the surrounding words (like negators or intensifiers).\n",
    "3. Combining these adjusted values into a single normalized compound score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any word not found in VADER's lexicon is assumed to carry no sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how VADER accounts not just for word presence but also for intensity cues like emphasis and punctuation to better capture sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes VADER Different?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to basic Bag-of-Words methods—which simply count words without considering their context—VADER goes further by analyzing word combinations, emphasis, and expressions that impact sentiment strength. This makes it especially useful for evaluating informal, expressive, and emotion-rich text such as social media posts, reviews, or comments.\n"
