## 📚 What is RefinedWeb?

RefinedWeb is a cleaned, filtered, and deduplicated web crawl dataset, optimized for training and evaluating large-scale language models. It includes high-quality, domain-specific text content suitable for commercial applications such as:

- Brand intelligence
- Product sentiment analysis
- Customer service automation

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to improve the visibility and relevance of AI-powered search and insight tools by training models on focused web content. Specifically, this helps:

- Improve brand visibility
- Support internal tools like search assistants and chatbots
- Provide actionable insights in:
  - Brand perception
  - Competitive intelligence
  - SEO performance
  - Campaign strategy optimization

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

- Development currently runs on limited compute resources for prototyping.
- **Apache Spark (PySpark)** is used for scalable preprocessing of large datasets.
- AI8 servers are supported for scaled or distributed computation.
- Cloud-native components and large-model training extensions may be added later.
- A **Dockerfile** is provided for reproducible environments.
- An optional `get-docker.sh` script is available for installing Docker on compatible systems.
